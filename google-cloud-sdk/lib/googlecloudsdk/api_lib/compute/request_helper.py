  Each request can be either a synchronous API call or an asynchronous
  one. For synchronous calls (e.g., get and list), the result from the
  server is yielded immediately. For asynchronous calls (e.g., calls
  that return operations like insert), this function waits until the
  operation reaches the DONE state and fetches the corresponding
  object and yields that object (nothing is yielded for deletions).

  Currently, a heterogenous set of synchronous calls can be made
  (e.g., get request to fetch a disk and instance), however, the
  asynchronous requests must be homogenous (e.g., they must all be the
  same verb on the same collection). In the future, heterogenous
  asynchronous requests will be supported. For now, it is up to the
  client to ensure that the asynchronous requests are
  homogenous. Synchronous and asynchronous requests can be mixed.

  Args:
    requests: A list of requests to make. Each element must be a 3-element tuple
      where the first element is the service, the second element is the string
      name of the method on the service, and the last element is a protocol
      buffer representing the request.

      to finish.
    followup_overrides: A list of new resource names to GET once the operation
      finishes. Generally used in renaming calls.

      tense of each request.
