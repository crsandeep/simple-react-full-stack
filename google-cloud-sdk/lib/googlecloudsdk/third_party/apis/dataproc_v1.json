Filters are case-sensitive and have the following syntax:field = value AND field = value ...where field is one of status.state, clusterName, or labels.[KEY], and [KEY] is a label key. value can be * to match all values. status.state can be one of the following: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, CREATING, RUNNING, ERROR, DELETING, or UPDATING. ACTIVE contains the CREATING, UPDATING, and RUNNING states. INACTIVE contains the DELETING and ERROR states. clusterName is the name of the cluster provided at creation time. Only the logical AND operator is supported; space-separated items are treated as having an implicit AND operator.Example filter:status.state = ACTIVE AND clusterName = mycluster AND labels.env = staging AND labels.starred = *",
