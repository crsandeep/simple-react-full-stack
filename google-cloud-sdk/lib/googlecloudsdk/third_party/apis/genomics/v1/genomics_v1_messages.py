  class CodeValueValuesEnum(_messages.Enum):
    r"""The Google standard error code that best describes this failure.

    Values:
      OK: Not an error; returned on success  HTTP Mapping: 200 OK
      CANCELLED: The operation was cancelled, typically by the caller.  HTTP
        Mapping: 499 Client Closed Request
      UNKNOWN: Unknown error.  For example, this error may be returned when a
        `Status` value received from another address space belongs to an error
        space that is not known in this address space.  Also errors raised by
        APIs that do not return enough error information may be converted to
        this error.  HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
      INVALID_ARGUMENT: The client specified an invalid argument.  Note that
        this differs from `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.  `INVALID_ARGUMENT` indicates
        arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system
        (e.g., a malformed file name).  HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
      DEADLINE_EXCEEDED: The deadline expired before the operation could
        complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this
        error may be returned even if the operation has completed
        successfully.  For example, a successful response from a server could
        have been delayed long enough for the deadline to expire.  HTTP
        Mapping: 504 Gateway Timeout
      NOT_FOUND: Some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not
        found.  Note to server developers: if a request is denied for an
        entire class of users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented
        whitelist, `NOT_FOUND` may be used. If a request is denied for some
        users within a class of users, such as user-based access control,
        `PERMISSION_DENIED` must be used.  HTTP Mapping: 404 Not Found
      ALREADY_EXISTS: The entity that a client attempted to create (e.g., file
        or directory) already exists.  HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
      PERMISSION_DENIED: The caller does not have permission to execute the
        specified operation. `PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used for
        rejections caused by exhausting some resource (use
        `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` instead for those errors). `PERMISSION_DENIED`
        must not be used if the caller can not be identified (use
        `UNAUTHENTICATED` instead for those errors). This error code does not
        imply the request is valid or the requested entity exists or satisfies
        other pre-conditions.  HTTP Mapping: 403 Forbidden
      UNAUTHENTICATED: The request does not have valid authentication
        credentials for the operation.  HTTP Mapping: 401 Unauthorized
      RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user
        quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space.  HTTP
        Mapping: 429 Too Many Requests
      FAILED_PRECONDITION: The operation was rejected because the system is
        not in a state required for the operation's execution.  For example,
        the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is
        applied to a non-directory, etc.  Service implementors can use the
        following guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
        `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`:  (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can
        retry just the failing call.  (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should
        retry at a higher level      (e.g., when a client-specified test-and-
        set fails, indicating the      client should restart a read-modify-
        write sequence).  (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should
        not retry until      the system state has been explicitly fixed.
        E.g., if an "rmdir"      fails because the directory is non-empty,
        `FAILED_PRECONDITION`      should be returned since the client should
        not retry unless      the files are deleted from the directory.  HTTP
        Mapping: 400 Bad Request
      ABORTED: The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue
        such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort.  See the
        guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
        `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`.  HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
      OUT_OF_RANGE: The operation was attempted past the valid range.  E.g.,
        seeking or reading past end-of-file.  Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this
        error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state
        changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will generate
        `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to read at an offset that is not in the
        range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read
        from an offset past the current file size.  There is a fair bit of
        overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.  We
        recommend using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific error) when it
        applies so that callers who are iterating through a space can easily
        look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they are done.  HTTP
        Mapping: 400 Bad Request
      UNIMPLEMENTED: The operation is not implemented or is not
        supported/enabled in this service.  HTTP Mapping: 501 Not Implemented
      INTERNAL: Internal errors.  This means that some invariants expected by
        the underlying system have been broken.  This error code is reserved
        for serious errors.  HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error
      UNAVAILABLE: The service is currently unavailable.  This is most likely
        a transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with a
        backoff. Note that it is not always safe to retry non-idempotent
        operations.  See the guidelines above for deciding between
        `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`.  HTTP Mapping:
        503 Service Unavailable
      DATA_LOSS: Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.  HTTP Mapping: 500
        Internal Server Error
