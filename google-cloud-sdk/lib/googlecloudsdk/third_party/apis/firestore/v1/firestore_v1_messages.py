      already present in the current field value. If the field is not an
      array, or if the field does not yet exist, it is first set to the empty
      array.  Equivalent numbers of different types (e.g. 3L and 3.0) are
      considered equal when checking if a value is missing. NaN is equal to
      NaN, and Null is equal to Null. If the input contains multiple
      equivalent values, only the first will be considered.  The corresponding
      transform_result will be the null value.
    fieldPath: The path of the field. See Document.fields for the field path
      syntax reference.
    increment: Adds the given value to the field's current value.  This must
      be an integer or a double value. If the field is not an integer or
      double, or if the field does not yet exist, the transformation will set
      the field to the given value. If either of the given value or the
      current field value are doubles, both values will be interpreted as
      doubles. Double arithmetic and representation of double values follow
      IEEE 754 semantics. If there is positive/negative integer overflow, the
      field is resolved to the largest magnitude positive/negative integer.
    maximum: Sets the field to the maximum of its current value and the given
      value.  This must be an integer or a double value. If the field is not
      an integer or double, or if the field does not yet exist, the
      transformation will set the field to the given value. If a maximum
      operation is applied where the field and the input value are of mixed
      types (that is - one is an integer and one is a double) the field takes
      on the type of the larger operand. If the operands are equivalent (e.g.
      3 and 3.0), the field does not change. 0, 0.0, and -0.0 are all zero.
      The maximum of a zero stored value and zero input value is always the
      stored value. The maximum of any numeric value x and NaN is NaN.
    minimum: Sets the field to the minimum of its current value and the given
      value.  This must be an integer or a double value. If the field is not
      an integer or double, or if the field does not yet exist, the
      transformation will set the field to the input value. If a minimum
      operation is applied where the field and the input value are of mixed
      types (that is - one is an integer and one is a double) the field takes
      on the type of the smaller operand. If the operands are equivalent (e.g.
      3 and 3.0), the field does not change. 0, 0.0, and -0.0 are all zero.
      The minimum of a zero stored value and zero input value is always the
      stored value. The minimum of any numeric value x and NaN is NaN.
    removeAllFromArray: Remove all of the given elements from the array in the

      it is set to the empty array.  Equivalent numbers of the different types
      (e.g. 3L and 3.0) are considered equal when deciding whether an element
      should be removed. NaN is equal to NaN, and Null is equal to Null. This
