However, to be added as an owner, a user must be\ninvited via Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation.\n\n+ A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user\nmust be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must\nexplicitly accept the invitation.\n\n+ Invitations to grant the owner role cannot be sent using\n`setIamPolicy()`; they must be sent only using the Cloud Platform Console.\n\n+ Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have\naccepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected.\n\n+ If the project is not part of an organization, there must be at least\none owner who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the\npolicy.
