class BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Action(_messages.Message):
  r"""An `Action` captures all the information about an execution which is
  required to reproduce it.  `Action`s are the core component of the
  [Execution] service. A single `Action` represents a repeatable action that
  can be performed by the execution service. `Action`s can be succinctly
  identified by the digest of their wire format encoding and, once an `Action`
  has been executed, will be cached in the action cache. Future requests can
  then use the cached result rather than needing to run afresh.  When a server
  completes execution of an Action, it MAY choose to cache the result in the
  ActionCache unless `do_not_cache` is `true`. Clients SHOULD expect the
  server to do so. By default, future calls to Execute the same `Action` will
  also serve their results from the cache. Clients must take care to
  understand the caching behaviour. Ideally, all `Action`s will be
  reproducible so that serving a result from cache is always desirable and
  correct.

  Fields:
    commandDigest: The digest of the Command to run, which MUST be present in
      the ContentAddressableStorage.
    doNotCache: If true, then the `Action`'s result cannot be cached, and in-
      flight requests for the same `Action` may not be merged.
    inputRootDigest: The digest of the root Directory for the input files. The
      files in the directory tree are available in the correct location on the
      build machine before the command is executed. The root directory, as
      well as every subdirectory and content blob referred to, MUST be in the
      ContentAddressableStorage.
    outputNodeProperties: List of required supported NodeProperty keys. In
      order to ensure that equivalent `Action`s always hash to the same value,
      the supported node properties MUST be lexicographically sorted by name.
      Sorting of strings is done by code point, equivalently, by the UTF-8
      bytes.  The interpretation of these properties is server-dependent. If a
      property is not recognized by the server, the server will return an
      `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
    timeout: A timeout after which the execution should be killed. If the
      timeout is absent, then the client is specifying that the execution
      should continue as long as the server will let it. The server SHOULD
      impose a timeout if the client does not specify one, however, if the
      client does specify a timeout that is longer than the server's maximum
      timeout, the server MUST reject the request.  The timeout is a part of
      the Action message, and therefore two `Actions` with different timeouts
      are different, even if they are otherwise identical. This is because, if
      they were not, running an `Action` with a lower timeout than is required
      might result in a cache hit from an execution run with a longer timeout,
      hiding the fact that the timeout is too short. By encoding it directly
      in the `Action`, a lower timeout will result in a cache miss and the
      execution timeout will fail immediately, rather than whenever the cache
      entry gets evicted.

  Fields:
    executionMetadata: The details of the execution that originally produced
      this result.
    exitCode: The exit code of the command.
    outputDirectories: The output directories of the action. For each output
      directory requested in the `output_directories` or `output_paths` field
      of the Action, if the corresponding directory existed after the action
      completed, a single entry will be present in the output list, which will
      contain the digest of a Tree message containing the directory tree, and
      the path equal exactly to the corresponding Action output_directories
      member.  As an example, suppose the Action had an output directory
      `a/b/dir` and the execution produced the following contents in
      `a/b/dir`: a file named `bar` and a directory named `foo` with an
      executable file named `baz`. Then, output_directory will contain (hashes
      shortened for readability):  ```json // OutputDirectory proto: {   path:

      is_executable: true       }     ]   } } ``` If an output of the same
      name as listed in `output_files` of the Command was found in
      `output_directories`, but was not a directory, the server will return a
      FAILED_PRECONDITION.
    outputDirectorySymlinks: The output directories of the action that are
      symbolic links to other directories. Those may be links to other output
      directories, or input directories, or even absolute paths outside of the
      working directory, if the server supports
      SymlinkAbsolutePathStrategy.ALLOWED. For each output directory requested
      in the `output_directories` field of the Action, if the directory
      existed after the action completed, a single entry will be present
      either in this field, or in the `output_directories` field, if the
      directory was not a symbolic link.  If an output of the same name was
      found, but was a symbolic link to a file instead of a directory, the
      server will return a FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the action does not produce
      the requested output, then that output will be omitted from the list.
      The server is free to arrange the output list as desired; clients MUST
      NOT assume that the output list is sorted.  DEPRECATED as of v2.1.
      Servers that wish to be compatible with v2.0 API should still populate
      this field in addition to `output_symlinks`.
    outputFileSymlinks: The output files of the action that are symbolic links
      to other files. Those may be links to other output files, or input
      files, or even absolute paths outside of the working directory, if the
      server supports SymlinkAbsolutePathStrategy.ALLOWED. For each output
      file requested in the `output_files` or `output_paths` field of the
      Action, if the corresponding file existed after the action completed, a
      single entry will be present either in this field, or in the
      `output_files` field, if the file was not a symbolic link.  If an output
      symbolic link of the same name as listed in `output_files` of the
      Command was found, but its target type was not a regular file, the
      server will return a FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the action does not produce

      then that output will be omitted from the list. The server is free to

    stderrDigest: The digest for a blob containing the standard error of the
      action, which can be retrieved from the ContentAddressableStorage.
    stderrRaw: The standard error buffer of the action. The server SHOULD NOT
      inline stderr unless requested by the client in the
      GetActionResultRequest message. The server MAY omit inlining, even if
      requested, and MUST do so if inlining would cause the response to exceed
      message size limits.

      action, which can be retrieved from the ContentAddressableStorage.
    stdoutRaw: The standard output buffer of the action. The server SHOULD NOT
      inline stdout unless requested by the client in the
      GetActionResultRequest message. The server MAY omit inlining, even if
      requested, and MUST do so if inlining would cause the response to exceed

class BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Command(_messages.Message):
  r"""A `Command` is the actual command executed by a worker running an Action
  and specifications of its environment.  Except as otherwise required, the
  environment (such as which system libraries or binaries are available, and
  what filesystems are mounted where) is defined by and specific to the
  implementation of the remote execution API.

  Fields:
    arguments: The arguments to the command. The first argument must be the
      path to the executable, which must be either a relative path, in which
      case it is evaluated with respect to the input root, or an absolute
      path.
    environmentVariables: The environment variables to set when running the
      program. The worker may provide its own default environment variables;
      these defaults can be overridden using this field. Additional variables
      can also be specified.  In order to ensure that equivalent Commands
      always hash to the same value, the environment variables MUST be
      lexicographically sorted by name. Sorting of strings is done by code
      point, equivalently, by the UTF-8 bytes.
    outputDirectories: A list of the output directories that the client
      expects to retrieve from the action. Only the listed directories will be
      returned (an entire directory structure will be returned as a Tree
      message digest, see OutputDirectory), as well as files listed in
      `output_files`. Other files or directories that may be created during
      command execution are discarded.  The paths are relative to the working
      directory of the action execution. The paths are specified using a
      single forward slash (`/`) as a path separator, even if the execution
      platform natively uses a different separator. The path MUST NOT include
      a trailing slash, nor a leading slash, being a relative path. The
      special value of empty string is allowed, although not recommended, and
      can be used to capture the entire working directory tree, including
      inputs.  In order to ensure consistent hashing of the same Action, the
      output paths MUST be sorted lexicographically by code point (or,
      equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes).  An output directory cannot be duplicated
      or have the same path as any of the listed output files. An output
      directory is allowed to be a parent of another output directory.
      Directories leading up to the output directories (but not the output
      directories themselves) are created by the worker prior to execution,
      even if they are not explicitly part of the input root.  DEPRECATED
      since 2.1: Use `output_paths` instead.
    outputFiles: A list of the output files that the client expects to
      retrieve from the action. Only the listed files, as well as directories
      listed in `output_directories`, will be returned to the client as
      output. Other files or directories that may be created during command

    outputPaths: A list of the output paths that the client expects to
      retrieve from the action. Only the listed paths will be returned to the
      client as output. The type of the output (file or directory) is not
      specified, and will be determined by the server after action execution.
      If the resulting path is a file, it will be returned in an OutputFile)

      will be returned as a Tree message digest, see OutputDirectory) Other

    platform: The platform requirements for the execution environment. The
      server MAY choose to execute the action on any worker satisfying the
      requirements, so the client SHOULD ensure that running the action on any
      such worker will have the same result. A detailed lexicon for this can
      be found in the accompanying platform.md.
    workingDirectory: The working directory, relative to the input root, for

class BuildBazelRemoteExecutionV2Digest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A content digest. A digest for a given blob consists of the size of the
  blob and its hash. The hash algorithm to use is defined by the server.  The
  size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be
  separated. That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but
  `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request.  The reason for
  including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great many cases, the
  server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work with prior to
  starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree structures or
  streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could implement a separate
  metadata store, but this results in a significantly more complicated
  implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size up-front (or
  storing the size along with the digest in every message where digests are
  embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation details of
  (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but we consider
  this to be a worthwhile tradeoff.  When a `Digest` is used to refer to a
  proto message, it always refers to the message in binary encoded form. To
  ensure consistent hashing, clients and servers MUST ensure that they
  serialize messages according to the following rules, even if there are
  alternate valid encodings for the same message:  * Fields are serialized in
  tag order. * There are no unknown fields. * There are no duplicate fields. *
  Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type.
  Most protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when
  serializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance,
  concatenating two messages to merge them may produce duplicate fields.

  Fields:
    hash: The hash. In the case of SHA-256, it will always be a lowercase hex
      string exactly 64 characters long.

  (either a file blob or a `Directory` proto) or a symlink target, as well as
  possibly some metadata about the file or directory.  In order to ensure that
  two equivalent directory trees hash to the same value, the following
  restrictions MUST be obeyed when constructing a a `Directory`:  * Every
  child in the directory must have a path of exactly one segment.   Multiple
  levels of directory hierarchy may not be collapsed. * Each child in the
  directory must have a unique path segment (file name).   Note that while the
  API itself is case-sensitive, the environment where   the Action is executed
  may or may not be case-sensitive. That is, it is   legal to call the API
  with a Directory that has both "Foo" and "foo" as   children, but the Action
  may be rejected by the remote system upon   execution. * The files,

  lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code
  point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes. * The NodeProperties of files,

      multiple expressions, you can separate expression using `AND` and `OR`
      operators, using parentheses to specify precedence. If neither operator
