  r"""A ComposerProjectsLocationsEnvironmentsPatchRequest object.

  Fields:
    environment: A Environment resource to be passed as the request body.
    name: The relative resource name of the environment to update, in the
      form: "projects/{projectId}/locations/{locationId}/environments/{environ
      mentId}"
    updateMask: Required. A comma-separated list of paths, relative to
      `Environment`, of fields to update. For example, to set the version of
      scikit-learn to install in the environment to 0.19.0 and to remove an
      existing installation of numpy, the `updateMask` parameter would include
      the following two `paths` values: "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages
      .scikit-learn" and "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.numpy". The
      included patch environment would specify the scikit-learn version as
      follows:      {       "config":{         "softwareConfig":{
      "pypiPackages":{             "scikit-learn":"==0.19.0"           }
      }       }     }  Note that in the above example, any existing PyPI
      packages other than scikit-learn and numpy will be unaffected.  Only one
      update type may be included in a single request's `updateMask`. For
      example, one cannot update both the PyPI packages and labels in the same
      request. However, it is possible to update multiple members of a map
      field simultaneously in the same request. For example, to set the labels
      "label1" and "label2" while clearing "label3" (assuming it already
      exists), one can provide the paths "labels.label1", "labels.label2", and
      "labels.label3" and populate the patch environment as follows:      {
      "labels":{         "label1":"new-label1-value"         "label2":"new-
      label2-value"       }     }  Note that in the above example, any
      existing labels that are not included in the `updateMask` will be
      unaffected.  It is also possible to replace an entire map field by
      providing the map field's path in the `updateMask`. The new value of the
      field will be that which is provided in the patch environment. For
      example, to delete all pre-existing user-specified PyPI packages and
      install botocore at version 1.7.14, the `updateMask` would contain the
      path "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages", and the patch environment
      would be the following:      {       "config":{
      "softwareConfig":{           "pypiPackages":{
      "botocore":"==1.7.14"           }         }       }     }  **Note:**
