  determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any,
  are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more
  AuditLogConfigs.  If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a
  specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that
  service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the

      identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google

    fingerprint: Provides a fingerprint to use in requests to modify a

      requests. A fingerprint is a randomly generated value that must be
      provided with `update()`, `stop()`, and `cancelPreview()` requests to
      perform optimistic locking. This ensures optimistic concurrency so that
      only one request happens at a time.  The fingerprint is initially
      generated by Deployment Manager and changes after every request to
      modify data. To get the latest fingerprint value, perform a `get()`
      request to a deployment.
    id: A string attribute.
    insertTime: Output only. Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
    labels: Map of labels; provided by the client when the resource is created

    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.

      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either

      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =

      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can

    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can

      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on

      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can

    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can

      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on

  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  Optionally, a
  `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
  allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
  condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
  resource, or both.  **JSON example:**  { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members":
  ["user:eve@example.com"], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 }  **YAML example:**  bindings: - members: -
  user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com -
  serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:
  roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable
  access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression:
  request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= -
  version: 3  For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    iamOwned:
    rules: If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the
      following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any
      DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied. Logging will be
      applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if
      any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is granted. Logging
      will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. -
      Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.  If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset.
