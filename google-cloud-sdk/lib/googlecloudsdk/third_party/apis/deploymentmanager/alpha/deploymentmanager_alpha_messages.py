      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each

      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest

      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either
      `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.  For example, if you are filtering Compute
      Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by
      specifying `name != example-instance`.  You can also filter nested
      fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart =
      false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic
      restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on
      resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example: ```
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ```
      By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can
      include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ```
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
      (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by `name`
      or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: The project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false and the
      logic is the same as today.

  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access

  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  Optionally, a
  `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
  allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
  condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
  resource, or both.  **JSON example:**  { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",

  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    iamOwned:
    rules: If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the
      following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any
      DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied. Logging will be
      applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if
      any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is granted. Logging
      will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. -
      Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
