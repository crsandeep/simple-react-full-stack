  Enums:
    EncodingValueValuesEnum: Encoding of audio data sent in all
      `RecognitionAudio` messages. This field is optional for `FLAC` and `WAV`
      audio files and required for all other audio formats. For details, see
      AudioEncoding.

  Fields:
    audioChannelCount: The number of channels in the input audio data. ONLY
      set this for MULTI-CHANNEL recognition. Valid values for LINEAR16 and
      FLAC are `1`-`8`. Valid values for OGG_OPUS are '1'-'254'. Valid value
      for MULAW, AMR, AMR_WB and SPEEX_WITH_HEADER_BYTE is only `1`. If `0` or
      omitted, defaults to one channel (mono). Note: We only recognize the
      first channel by default. To perform independent recognition on each
      channel set `enable_separate_recognition_per_channel` to 'true'.
    diarizationConfig: Config to enable speaker diarization and set additional
      parameters to make diarization better suited for your application. Note:
      When this is enabled, we send all the words from the beginning of the
      audio for the top alternative in every consecutive STREAMING responses.
      This is done in order to improve our speaker tags as our models learn to
      identify the speakers in the conversation over time. For non-streaming
      requests, the diarization results will be provided only in the top
      alternative of the FINAL SpeechRecognitionResult.
    enableAutomaticPunctuation: If 'true', adds punctuation to recognition
      result hypotheses. This feature is only available in select languages.
      Setting this for requests in other languages has no effect at all. The
      default 'false' value does not add punctuation to result hypotheses.
      Note: This is currently offered as an experimental service,
      complimentary to all users. In the future this may be exclusively
      available as a premium feature.
    enableSeparateRecognitionPerChannel: This needs to be set to `true`
      explicitly and `audio_channel_count` > 1 to get each channel recognized
      separately. The recognition result will contain a `channel_tag` field to
      state which channel that result belongs to. If this is not true, we will
      only recognize the first channel. The request is billed cumulatively for
      all channels recognized: `audio_channel_count` multiplied by the length
      of the audio.
    enableWordTimeOffsets: If `true`, the top result includes a list of words
      and the start and end time offsets (timestamps) for those words. If
      `false`, no word-level time offset information is returned. The default
      is `false`.
    encoding: Encoding of audio data sent in all `RecognitionAudio` messages.
      This field is optional for `FLAC` and `WAV` audio files and required for
      all other audio formats. For details, see AudioEncoding.
    languageCode: Required. The language of the supplied audio as a
      [BCP-47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) language tag.
      Example: "en-US". See [Language Support](https://cloud.google.com
      /speech-to-text/docs/languages) for a list of the currently supported
      language codes.
    maxAlternatives: Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned.
      Specifically, the maximum number of `SpeechRecognitionAlternative`
      messages within each `SpeechRecognitionResult`. The server may return
      fewer than `max_alternatives`. Valid values are `0`-`30`. A value of `0`
      or `1` will return a maximum of one. If omitted, will return a maximum
      of one.
    metadata: Metadata regarding this request.
    model: Which model to select for the given request. Select the model best
      suited to your domain to get best results. If a model is not explicitly
      specified, then we auto-select a model based on the parameters in the
      RecognitionConfig. <table>   <tr>     <td><b>Model</b></td>
      <td><b>Description</b></td>   </tr>   <tr>
      <td><code>command_and_search</code></td>     <td>Best for short queries
      such as voice commands or voice search.</td>   </tr>   <tr>
      <td><code>phone_call</code></td>     <td>Best for audio that originated
      from a phone call (typically     recorded at an 8khz sampling
      rate).</td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td><code>video</code></td>     <td>Best
      for audio that originated from from video or includes multiple
      speakers. Ideally the audio is recorded at a 16khz or greater
      sampling rate. This is a premium model that costs more than the
      standard rate.</td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td><code>default</code></td>
      <td>Best for audio that is not one of the specific audio models.
      For example, long-form audio. Ideally the audio is high-fidelity,
      recorded at a 16khz or greater sampling rate.</td>   </tr> </table>
    profanityFilter: If set to `true`, the server will attempt to filter out
      profanities, replacing all but the initial character in each filtered
      word with asterisks, e.g. "f***". If set to `false` or omitted,
      profanities won't be filtered out.
    sampleRateHertz: Sample rate in Hertz of the audio data sent in all
      `RecognitionAudio` messages. Valid values are: 8000-48000. 16000 is
      optimal. For best results, set the sampling rate of the audio source to
      16000 Hz. If that's not possible, use the native sample rate of the
      audio source (instead of re-sampling). This field is optional for FLAC
      and WAV audio files, but is required for all other audio formats. For
      details, see AudioEncoding.
    speechContexts: Array of SpeechContext. A means to provide context to
      assist the speech recognition. For more information, see [speech
      adaptation](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/context-
      strength).
    useEnhanced: Set to true to use an enhanced model for speech recognition.
      If `use_enhanced` is set to true and the `model` field is not set, then
      an appropriate enhanced model is chosen if an enhanced model exists for
      the audio.  If `use_enhanced` is true and an enhanced version of the
      specified model does not exist, then the speech is recognized using the
      standard version of the specified model.

    r"""Encoding of audio data sent in all `RecognitionAudio` messages. This
    field is optional for `FLAC` and `WAV` audio files and required for all

    Values:
      ENCODING_UNSPECIFIED: Not specified.
      LINEAR16: Uncompressed 16-bit signed little-endian samples (Linear PCM).
      FLAC: `FLAC` (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is the recommended encoding
        because it is lossless--therefore recognition is not compromised--and
        requires only about half the bandwidth of `LINEAR16`. `FLAC` stream
        encoding supports 16-bit and 24-bit samples, however, not all fields
        in `STREAMINFO` are supported.
      MULAW: 8-bit samples that compand 14-bit audio samples using G.711 PCMU
        /mu-law.
      AMR: Adaptive Multi-Rate Narrowband codec. `sample_rate_hertz` must be
        8000.
      AMR_WB: Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband codec. `sample_rate_hertz` must be
        16000.
      OGG_OPUS: Opus encoded audio frames in Ogg container
        ([OggOpus](https://wiki.xiph.org/OggOpus)). `sample_rate_hertz` must
        be one of 8000, 12000, 16000, 24000, or 48000.
      SPEEX_WITH_HEADER_BYTE: Although the use of lossy encodings is not
        recommended, if a very low bitrate encoding is required, `OGG_OPUS` is
        highly preferred over Speex encoding. The [Speex](https://speex.org/)
        encoding supported by Cloud Speech API has a header byte in each
        block, as in MIME type `audio/x-speex-with-header-byte`. It is a
        variant of the RTP Speex encoding defined in [RFC
        5574](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5574). The stream is a sequence
        of blocks, one block per RTP packet. Each block starts with a byte
        containing the length of the block, in bytes, followed by one or more
        frames of Speex data, padded to an integral number of bytes (octets)
        as specified in RFC 5574. In other words, each RTP header is replaced
        with a single byte containing the block length. Only Speex wideband is
        supported. `sample_rate_hertz` must be 16000.
