  provided.

  Fields:
    desiredAddonsConfig: Configurations for the various addons available to
      run in the cluster.
    desiredBinaryAuthorization: The desired configuration options for the
      Binary Authorization feature.
    desiredClusterAutoscaling: Cluster-level autoscaling configuration.
    desiredClusterTelemetry: The desired telemetry integration for the
      cluster.
    desiredDatabaseEncryption: Configuration of etcd encryption.
    desiredDefaultSnatStatus: The desired status of whether to disable default
      sNAT for this cluster.
    desiredEnableGvnic: Enable or disable gvnic on this cluster. This field is
      not yet used.
    desiredImage: The desired name of the image to use for this node. This is
      used to create clusters using a custom image.
    desiredImageProject: The project containing the desired image to use for
      this node. This is used to create clusters using a custom image.
    desiredImageType: The desired image type for the node pool. NOTE: Set the
      "desired_node_pool" field as well.
    desiredIntraNodeVisibilityConfig: The desired config of Intra-node
      visibility.
    desiredLocations: The desired list of Google Compute Engine
      [zones](/compute/docs/zones#available) in which the cluster's nodes
      should be located. Changing the locations a cluster is in will result in
      nodes being either created or removed from the cluster, depending on
      whether locations are being added or removed.  This list must always
      include the cluster's primary zone.
    desiredLoggingService: The logging service the cluster should use to write
      logs. Currently available options:  *
      `logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes` - The Cloud Logging service with a
      Kubernetes-native resource model * `logging.googleapis.com` - The legacy
      Cloud Logging service (no longer   available as of GKE 1.15). * `none` -
      no logs will be exported from the cluster.  If left as an empty
      string,`logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes` will be used for GKE 1.14+ or
      `logging.googleapis.com` for earlier versions.
    desiredMasterAuthorizedNetworksConfig: The desired configuration options
      for master authorized networks feature.
    desiredMasterVersion: The Kubernetes version to change the master to. The
      only valid value is the latest supported version.  Users may specify
      either explicit versions offered by Kubernetes Engine or version
      aliases, which have the following behavior:  - "latest": picks the
      highest valid Kubernetes version - "1.X": picks the highest valid
      patch+gke.N patch in the 1.X version - "1.X.Y": picks the highest valid
      gke.N patch in the 1.X.Y version - "1.X.Y-gke.N": picks an explicit
      Kubernetes version - "-": picks the default Kubernetes version
    desiredMonitoringService: The monitoring service the cluster should use to
      write metrics. Currently available options:  *
      "monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes" - The Cloud Monitoring service
      with a Kubernetes-native resource model * `monitoring.googleapis.com` -
      The legacy Cloud Monitoring service (no   longer available as of GKE
      1.15). * `none` - No metrics will be exported from the cluster.  If left
      as an empty string,`monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes` will be used
      for GKE 1.14+ or `monitoring.googleapis.com` for earlier versions.
    desiredNodePoolAutoscaling: Autoscaler configuration for the node pool
      specified in desired_node_pool_id. If there is only one pool in the
      cluster and desired_node_pool_id is not provided then the change applies
      to that single node pool.
    desiredNodePoolId: The node pool to be upgraded. This field is mandatory
      if "desired_node_version", "desired_image_family",
      "desired_node_pool_autoscaling", or "desired_workload_metadata_config"
      is specified and there is more than one node pool on the cluster.
    desiredNodeVersion: The Kubernetes version to change the nodes to
      (typically an upgrade).  Users may specify either explicit versions
      offered by Kubernetes Engine or version aliases, which have the
      following behavior:  - "latest": picks the highest valid Kubernetes
      version - "1.X": picks the highest valid patch+gke.N patch in the 1.X
      version - "1.X.Y": picks the highest valid gke.N patch in the 1.X.Y
      version - "1.X.Y-gke.N": picks an explicit Kubernetes version - "-":
      picks the Kubernetes master version

      SECURE: Prevent workloads not in hostNetwork from accessing certain VM
        metadata, specifically kube-env, which contains Kubelet credentials,
        and the instance identity token.  Metadata concealment is a temporary
        security solution available while the bootstrapping process for
        cluster nodes is being redesigned with significant security
        improvements.  This feature is scheduled to be deprecated in the
        future and later removed.
      EXPOSE: Expose all VM metadata to pods.
      GKE_METADATA_SERVER: Run the GKE Metadata Server on this node. The GKE
        Metadata Server exposes a metadata API to workloads that is compatible
        with the V1 Compute Metadata APIs exposed by the Compute Engine and
        App Engine Metadata Servers. This feature can only be enabled if
        Workload Identity is enabled at the cluster level.
