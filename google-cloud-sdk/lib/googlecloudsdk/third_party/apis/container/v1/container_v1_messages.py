      otherwise, if no Service Account is specified, the "default" service
      account is used.
    shieldedInstanceConfig: Shielded Instance options.
    tags: The list of instance tags applied to all nodes. Tags are used to

  nodes that can be simultaneously unavailable.  maxSurge controls the number
  of additional nodes that can be added to the node pool temporarily for the
  time of the upgrade to increase the number of available nodes.
  (maxUnavailable + maxSurge) determines the level of parallelism (how many
  nodes are being upgraded at the same time).  Note: upgrades inevitably
  introduce some disruption since workloads need to be moved from old nodes to
  new, upgraded ones. Even if maxUnavailable=0, this holds true. (Disruption
  stays within the limits of PodDisruptionBudget, if it is configured.)
  Consider a hypothetical node pool with 5 nodes having maxSurge=2,
  maxUnavailable=1. This means the upgrade process upgrades 3 nodes
  simultaneously. It creates 2 additional (upgraded) nodes, then it brings
  down 3 old (not yet upgraded) nodes at the same time. This ensures that
  there are always at least 4 nodes available.
