class Aggregation(_messages.Message):
  r"""Describes how to combine multiple time series to provide a different
  view of the data. Aggregation of time series is done in two steps. First,
  each time series in the set is aligned to the same time interval boundaries,
  then the set of time series is optionally reduced in number.Alignment
  consists of applying the per_series_aligner operation to each time series
  after its data has been divided into regular alignment_period time
  intervals. This process takes all of the data points in an alignment period,
  applies a mathematical transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum,
  delta, etc., and converts them into a single data point per period.Reduction
  is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be combined,
  reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical
  transformations. Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all
  the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with
  group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series
  data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources.
  Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable
  and representative collection of data, for example "the 95% latency across
  the average of all tasks in a cluster". This representative data can be more
  easily graphed and comprehended, and the individual time series data is
  still available for later drilldown. For more details, see Filtering and
  aggregation (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/aggregation).

  Enums:
    CrossSeriesReducerValueValuesEnum: The reduction operation to be used to
      combine time series into a single time series, where the value of each
      data point in the resulting series is a function of all the already
      aligned values in the input time series.Not all reducer operations can
      be applied to all time series. The valid choices depend on the
      metric_kind and the value_type of the original time series. Reduction
      can yield a time series with a different metric_kind or value_type than
      the input time series.Time series data must first be aligned (see
      per_series_aligner) in order to perform cross-time series reduction. If
      cross_series_reducer is specified, then per_series_aligner must be
      specified, and must not be ALIGN_NONE. An alignment_period must also be
      specified; otherwise, an error is returned.
    PerSeriesAlignerValueValuesEnum: An Aligner describes how to bring the
      data points in a single time series into temporal alignment. Except for
      ALIGN_NONE, all alignments cause all the data points in an
      alignment_period to be mathematically grouped together, resulting in a
      single data point for each alignment_period with end timestamp at the
      end of the period.Not all alignment operations may be applied to all
      time series. The valid choices depend on the metric_kind and value_type
      of the original time series. Alignment can change the metric_kind or the
      value_type of the time series.Time series data must be aligned in order
      to perform cross-time series reduction. If cross_series_reducer is
      specified, then per_series_aligner must be specified and not equal to
      ALIGN_NONE and alignment_period must be specified; otherwise, an error
      is returned.

  Fields:
    alignmentPeriod: The alignment_period specifies a time interval, in
      seconds, that is used to divide the data in all the time series into
      consistent blocks of time. This will be done before the per-series
      aligner can be applied to the data.The value must be at least 60
      seconds. If a per-series aligner other than ALIGN_NONE is specified,
      this field is required or an error is returned. If no per-series aligner
      is specified, or the aligner ALIGN_NONE is specified, then this field is
      ignored.
    crossSeriesReducer: The reduction operation to be used to combine time
      series into a single time series, where the value of each data point in
      the resulting series is a function of all the already aligned values in
      the input time series.Not all reducer operations can be applied to all
      time series. The valid choices depend on the metric_kind and the
      value_type of the original time series. Reduction can yield a time
      series with a different metric_kind or value_type than the input time
      series.Time series data must first be aligned (see per_series_aligner)
      in order to perform cross-time series reduction. If cross_series_reducer
      is specified, then per_series_aligner must be specified, and must not be
      ALIGN_NONE. An alignment_period must also be specified; otherwise, an
      error is returned.
    groupByFields: The set of fields to preserve when cross_series_reducer is
      specified. The group_by_fields determine how the time series are
      partitioned into subsets prior to applying the aggregation operation.
      Each subset contains time series that have the same value for each of
      the grouping fields. Each individual time series is a member of exactly
      one subset. The cross_series_reducer is applied to each subset of time
      series. It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so
      this field implicitly contains resource.type. Fields not specified in
      group_by_fields are aggregated away. If group_by_fields is not specified
      and all the time series have the same resource type, then the time
      series are aggregated into a single output time series. If
      cross_series_reducer is not defined, this field is ignored.
    perSeriesAligner: An Aligner describes how to bring the data points in a
      single time series into temporal alignment. Except for ALIGN_NONE, all
      alignments cause all the data points in an alignment_period to be
      mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
      each alignment_period with end timestamp at the end of the period.Not
      all alignment operations may be applied to all time series. The valid
      choices depend on the metric_kind and value_type of the original time
      series. Alignment can change the metric_kind or the value_type of the
      time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-
      time series reduction. If cross_series_reducer is specified, then
      per_series_aligner must be specified and not equal to ALIGN_NONE and
      alignment_period must be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.

        aligner is valid for GAUGE and DELTA metrics with numeric values. This
        alignment returns ((current - previous)/previous) * 100, where the
        value of previous is determined based on the alignment_period.If the
        values of current and previous are both 0, then the returned value is
        0. If only previous is 0, the returned value is infinity.A 10-minute
        moving mean is computed at each point of the alignment period prior to
        the above calculation to smooth the metric and prevent false positives
        from very short-lived spikes. The moving mean is only applicable for
        data whose values are >= 0. Any values < 0 are treated as a missing
        datapoint, and are ignored. While DELTA metrics are accepted by this
        alignment, special care should be taken that the values for the metric
        will always be positive. The output is a GAUGE metric with value_type
        DOUBLE.
