      references, such as GetPatientEverything, do not return all the results
      if broken references exist.
    disableResourceVersioning: Whether to disable resource versioning for this
      FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation of FHIR
      store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write
      operations cause historical versions to be recorded automatically. The
      historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but cannot
      be updated. If set to true, no historical versions are kept. The server
      sends errors for attempts to read the historical versions.
    enableUpdateCreate: Whether this FHIR store has the [updateCreate
      capability](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-
      definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.updateCreate). This
      determines if the client can use an Update operation to create a new
      resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-
      assigned through the Create operation and attempts to update a non-
      existent resource return errors. Please treat the audit logs with
      appropriate levels of care if client-specified resource IDs contain
      sensitive data such as patient identifiers, those IDs are part of the
      FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Cloud Pub/Sub
      notifications.
    labels: User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize FHIR stores.  Label
      keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of
      maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular
      expression: \p{Ll}\p{Lo}{0,62}  Label values are optional, must be
      between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128
      bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression:
      [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63}  No more than 64 labels can be associated
      with a given store.
    name: Output only. Resource name of the FHIR store, of the form
      `projects/{project_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}`
      .
    notificationConfig: If non-empty, publish all resource modifications of
      this FHIR store to this destination. The Cloud Pub/Sub message
      attributes contain a map with a string describing the action that has
      triggered the notification. For example, "action":"CreateResource".
    streamConfigs: A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations
      of streaming export for every resource mutation in this FHIR store. Each
      store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config
      is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in
      addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list,
      the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config,
      you must add the required
      [`bigquery.dataEditor`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-
      control#bigquery.dataEditor) role to your project's **Cloud Healthcare
      Service Agent** [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs
      /service-accounts). Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of
      seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming
      destination.
    version: The FHIR specification version that this FHIR store supports
      natively. This field is immutable after store creation. Requests are
      rejected if they contain FHIR resources of a different version. An empty

  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources.   A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  Optionally, a
  `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
  allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
  condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
  resource, or both.  **JSON example:**      {       "bindings": [         {
  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",           "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com",             "group:admins@example.com",

  version: 3  For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy   that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.  If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset.

  Fields:
    bigqueryDestination: The destination BigQuery structure that contains both
      the dataset location and corresponding schema config.  The output is
      organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing
      tables (if any) that are named after the resource types, e.g. "Patient",
      "Observation". When there is no existing table for a given resource
      type, the server attempts to create one.  When a table schema doesn't
      align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible
      schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not
      stream in new data.  BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert
      row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB
      of BigQuery data will not be streamed.  One resolution in this case is
      to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though
      the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation.
      Results are appended to the corresponding BigQuery tables. Different
      versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId
      and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that
      results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag.  The tables
      contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled.
      For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the
      same name containing only the current resource version.  If a resource
      mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors will be logged to
      Stackdriver (see [Viewing logs](/healthcare/docs/how- tos/stackdriver-
      logging)).
    resourceTypes: Supply a FHIR resource type (such as "Patient" or
      "Observation"). See https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-resource-
      types.html for a list of all FHIR resource types. The server treats an
      empty list as an intent to stream all the supported resource types in
