class AppEngineHttpRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""App Engine HTTP request.  The message defines the HTTP request that is
  sent to an App Engine app when the task is dispatched.  This proto can only
  be used for tasks in a queue which has app_engine_http_target set.  Using
  AppEngineHttpRequest requires
  [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs
  /admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for the project and the
  following scope:  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`  The task
  will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to the same project as
  the queue. For more information, see [How Requests are
  Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-
  requests-are-routed) and how routing is affected by [dispatch
  files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref).
  Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters.
  Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to
  Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS).
  The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP
  protocol.  The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is
  delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level:  * If set,
  app_engine_routing_override   is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter
  what the setting   is for the   task-level app_engine_routing.   The `url`
  that the task will be sent to is:  * `url =` host `+`   relative_url  Tasks
  can be dispatched to secure app handlers, unsecure app handlers, and URIs
  restricted with [`login: admin`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/sta
  ndard/python/config/appref). Because tasks are not run as any user, they
  cannot be dispatched to URIs restricted with [`login: required`](https://clo
  ud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref) Task dispatches
  also do not follow redirects.  The task attempt has succeeded if the app's
  request handler returns an HTTP response code in the range [`200` - `299`].
  The task attempt has failed if the app's handler returns a non-2xx response
  code or Cloud Tasks does not receive response before the deadline. Failed
  tasks will be retried according to the retry configuration. `503` (Service
  Unavailable) is considered an App Engine system error instead of an
  application error and will cause Cloud Tasks' traffic congestion control to
  temporarily throttle the queue's dispatches. Unlike other types of task
  targets, a `429` (Too Many Requests) response from an app handler does not
  cause traffic congestion control to throttle the queue.

  Enums:
    HttpMethodValueValuesEnum: The HTTP method to use for the request. The
      default is POST.  The app's request handler for the task's target URL
      must be able to handle HTTP requests with this http_method, otherwise
      the task attempt fails with error code 405 (Method Not Allowed). See

      handler](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/taskqueue/push

  Messages:
    HeadersValue: HTTP request headers.  This map contains the header field
      names and values. Headers can be set when the task is created. Repeated
      headers are not supported but a header value can contain commas.  Cloud
      Tasks sets some headers to default values:  * `User-Agent`: By default,
      this header is   `"AppEngine-Google;
      (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"`.   This header can be modified,
      but Cloud Tasks will append   `"AppEngine-Google;
      (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"` to the   modified `User-Agent`.
      If the task has a payload, Cloud Tasks sets the following headers:  *
      `Content-Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to
      `"application/octet-stream"`. The default can be overridden by
      explicitly   setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the
      task is created.   For example, `Content-Type` can be set to
      `"application/json"`. * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud
      Tasks. This value is   output only.   It cannot be changed.  The headers
      below cannot be set or overridden:  * `Host` * `X-Google-*` *
      `X-AppEngine-*`  In addition, Cloud Tasks sets some headers when the
      task is dispatched, such as headers containing information about the
      task; see [request
      headers](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/taskqueue/push
      /creating-handlers#reading_request_headers). These headers are set only
      when the task is dispatched, so they are not visible when the task is
      returned in a Cloud Tasks response.  Although there is no specific limit
      for the maximum number of headers or the size, there is a limit on the
      maximum size of the Task. For more information, see the CreateTask
      documentation.

  Fields:
    appEngineRouting: Task-level setting for App Engine routing.  If set,
      app_engine_routing_override is used for all tasks in the queue, no
      matter what the setting is for the task-level app_engine_routing.

      Handled](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/how-
      requests-are-handled).
    payload: Payload.  The payload will be sent as the HTTP message body. A
      message body, and thus a payload, is allowed only if the HTTP method is
      POST or PUT. It is an error to set a data payload on a task with an
      incompatible HttpMethod.
    relativeUrl: The relative URL.  The relative URL must begin with "/" and
      must be a valid HTTP relative URL. It can contain a path and query
      string arguments. If the relative URL is empty, then the root path "/"
      will be used. No spaces are allowed, and the maximum length allowed is
      2083 characters.

    task: Required. The task to add.  Task names have the following format:

      will be set in the task returned in the response.  If schedule_time is
      not set or is in the past then Cloud Tasks will set it to the current
      time.  Task De-duplication:  Explicitly specifying a task ID enables
      task de-duplication.  If a task's ID is identical to that of an existing
      task or a task that was deleted or completed recently then the call will
      fail with ALREADY_EXISTS. If the task's queue was created using Cloud
      Tasks, then another task with the same name can't be created for ~1hour
      after the original task was deleted or completed. If the task's queue
      was created using queue.yaml or queue.xml, then another task with the
      same name can't be created for ~9days after the original task was
      deleted or completed.  Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify
      duplicate task names, these CreateTask calls have significantly
      increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or for the
      prefix of the task id is recommended. Choosing task ids that are
      sequential or have sequential prefixes, for example using a timestamp,
      causes an increase in latency and error rates in all task commands. The
      infrastructure relies on an approximately uniform distribution of task
      ids to store and serve tasks efficiently.

  Fields:

      tasks whose tag is equal to `<my-tag>`. `<my-tag>` must be less than 500
      characters.  When `filter` is set to `tag_function=oldest_tag()`, only

      will be returned.  Grammar Syntax:  * `filter = "tag=" tag |
      "tag_function=" function`  * `tag = string`  * `function =
      "oldest_tag()"`  The `oldest_tag()` function returns tasks which have

      encoded tags can be used in Cloud Tasks. Tag which aren't UTF-8 encoded
      can't be used in the filter and the task's tag will be displayed as
      empty in Cloud Tasks.
    leaseDuration: Required. The duration of the lease.  Each task returned in
      the response will have its schedule_time set to the current time plus
      the `lease_duration`. The task is leased until its schedule_time; thus,
      the task will not be returned to another LeaseTasks call before its
      schedule_time.   After the worker has successfully finished the work
      associated with the task, the worker must call via AcknowledgeTask
      before the schedule_time. Otherwise the task will be returned to a later
      LeaseTasks call so that another worker can retry it.  The maximum lease
      duration is 1 week. `lease_duration` will be truncated to the nearest
      second.
    maxTasks: The maximum number of tasks to lease.  The system will make a
      best effort to return as close to as `max_tasks` as possible.  The
      largest that `max_tasks` can be is 1000.  The maximum total size of a

  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources.   A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  Optionally, a
  `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
  allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
  condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
  resource, or both.  **JSON example:**      {       "bindings": [         {
  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",           "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com",             "group:admins@example.com",

  version: 3  For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy   that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.  If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset.

      The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is
      used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token
      bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by
      `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed
      from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue's bucket runs
      out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens
      based on max_tasks_dispatched_per_second.  Cloud Tasks will pick the
      value of `max_burst_size` based on the value of
      max_tasks_dispatched_per_second.  For App Engine queues that were

      [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/co

      UpdateQueue is called on a queue created by `queue.yaml/xml`,
