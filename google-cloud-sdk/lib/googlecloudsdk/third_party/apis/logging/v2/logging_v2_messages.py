  BucketOptions does not include the number of values in each bucket.A bucket
  has an inclusive lower bound and exclusive upper bound for the values that
  are counted for that bucket. The upper bound of a bucket must be strictly
  greater than the lower bound. The sequence of N buckets for a distribution
  consists of an underflow bucket (number 0), zero or more finite buckets
  (number 1 through N - 2) and an overflow bucket (number N - 1). The buckets
  are contiguous: the lower bound of bucket i (i > 0) is the same as the upper
  bound of bucket i - 1. The buckets span the whole range of finite values:
  lower bound of the underflow bucket is -infinity and the upper bound of the
  overflow bucket is +infinity. The finite buckets are so-called because both
  bounds are finite.

      received in, such as "us-east1".

      entry.Example: a log entry that reports a database error would be
      associated with the monitored resource designating the particular
      database that reported the error.
    severity: Optional. The severity of the log entry. The default value is
      LogSeverity.DEFAULT.
    sourceLocation: Optional. Source code location information associated with
      the log entry, if any.
    spanId: Optional. The span ID within the trace associated with the log
      entry.For Trace spans, this is the same format that the Trace API v2
      uses: a 16-character hexadecimal encoding of an 8-byte array, such as
      000000000000004a.
    textPayload: The log entry payload, represented as a Unicode string
      (UTF-8).
    timestamp: Optional. The time the event described by the log entry
      occurred. This time is used to compute the log entry's age and to
      enforce the logs retention period. If this field is omitted in a new log
      entry, then Logging assigns it the current time. Timestamps have
      nanosecond accuracy, but trailing zeros in the fractional seconds might
      be omitted when the timestamp is displayed.Incoming log entries must
      have timestamps that don't exceed the logs retention period in the past,
      and that don't exceed 24 hours in the future. Log entries outside those
      time boundaries aren't ingested by Logging.
    trace: Optional. Resource name of the trace associated with the log entry,
      if any. If it contains a relative resource name, the name is assumed to
      be relative to //tracing.googleapis.com. Example: projects/my-
      projectid/traces/06796866738c859f2f19b7cfb3214824
    traceSampled: Optional. The sampling decision of the trace associated with
      the log entry.True means that the trace resource name in the trace field
      was sampled for storage in a trace backend. False means that the trace
      was not sampled for storage when this log entry was written, or the
      sampling decision was unknown at the time. A non-sampled trace value is
      still useful as a request correlation identifier. The default is False.

      EXTRACT(field) or REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The argument are:  1.
      field: The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be
      extracted.  2. regex: A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax
      (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture  group
      to extract data from the specified log entry field. The value  of the
      field is converted to a string before applying the regex.  It is an
      error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one  capture
      group.The result of the extraction must be convertible to a double type,
      as the distribution always records double values. If either the
      extraction or the conversion to double fails, then those values are not
      recorded in the distribution.Example:
      REGEXP_EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request, ".*quantity=(\d+).*")

    metadata: Optional. Metadata which can be used to guide usage of the

      is identified partially by a metric type and a
      MonitoredResourceDescriptor, that is associated with this metric type
      can only be associated with one of the monitored resource types listed
      here.
    name: The resource name of the metric descriptor.
    type: The metric type, including its DNS name prefix. The type is not URL-
      encoded. All user-defined metric types have the DNS name
      custom.googleapis.com or external.googleapis.com. Metric types should
      use a natural hierarchical grouping. For example:
      "custom.googleapis.com/invoice/paid/amount"
      "external.googleapis.com/prometheus/up"
      "appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies"
    unit: The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only
      applicable if the value_type is INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The unit
      defines the representation of the stored metric values.Different systems
      may scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a value of 0.02KBy
      might be displayed as 20By, and a value of 3523KBy might be displayed as
      3.5MBy). However, if the unit is KBy, then the value of the metric is
      always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be displayed..If you
      want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a
      job, you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or
      equivalently 1s{CPU} or just s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds,
      then the value is written as 12005.Alternatively, if you want a custom
      metric to record data in a more granular way, you can create a DOUBLE
      CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value 12.005
      (which is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is
      12005/1024).The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for
      Units of Measure (http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:Basic
      units (UNIT) bit bit By byte s second min minute h hour d dayPrefixes
      (PREFIX) k kilo (10^3) M mega (10^6) G giga (10^9) T tera (10^12) P peta

      Gi gibi (2^30) Ti tebi (2^40) Pi pebi (2^50)GrammarThe grammar also
      includes these connectors: / division or ratio (as an infix operator).
      For examples,  kBy/{email} or MiBy/10ms (although you should almost
      never  have /s in a metric unit; rates should always be computed at
      query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value). .
      multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For  examples,
      GBy.d or k{watt}.h.The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression =
      Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ;  Component = ( [ PREFIX
      ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation ]           | Annotation           | "1"
      ;  Annotation = "{" NAME "}" ; Notes: Annotation is just a comment if it
      follows a UNIT. If the annotation  is used alone, then the unit is
      equivalent to 1. For examples,  {request}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s ==
      By/s. NAME is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not
      containing { or }. 1 represents a unitary dimensionless  unit
      (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such  as in
      1/s. It is typically used when none of the basic units are  appropriate.
      For example, "new users per day" can be represented as  1/d or {new-
      users}/d (and a metric value 5 would mean "5 new  users). Alternatively,
      "thousands of page views per day" would be  represented as 1000/d or
      k1/d or k{page_views}/d (and a metric  value of 5.3 would mean "5300
      page views per day"). % represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and
      annotates values giving  a percentage (so the metric values are
      typically in the range of 0..100,  and a metric value 3 means "3

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Optional. Default labels that are added to the labels field
      of all log entries in entries. If a log entry already has a label with
      the same key as a label in this parameter, then the log entry's label is
      not changed. See LogEntry.

  Fields:
    dryRun: Optional. If true, the request should expect normal response, but
      the entries won't be persisted nor exported. Useful for checking whether
      the logging API endpoints are working properly before sending valuable
      data.
    entries: Required. The log entries to send to Logging. The order of log
      entries in this list does not matter. Values supplied in this method's
      log_name, resource, and labels fields are copied into those log entries
      in this list that do not include values for their corresponding fields.
      For more information, see the LogEntry type.If the timestamp or
      insert_id fields are missing in log entries, then this method supplies
      the current time or a unique identifier, respectively. The supplied
      values are chosen so that, among the log entries that did not supply
      their own values, the entries earlier in the list will sort before the
      entries later in the list. See the entries.list method.Log entries with
      timestamps that are more than the logs retention period in the past or
      more than 24 hours in the future will not be available when calling
      entries.list. However, those log entries can still be exported with
      LogSinks.To improve throughput and to avoid exceeding the quota limit
      for calls to entries.write, you should try to include several log
      entries in this list, rather than calling this method for each
      individual log entry.
    labels: Optional. Default labels that are added to the labels field of all
      log entries in entries. If a log entry already has a label with the same
      key as a label in this parameter, then the log entry's label is not
      changed. See LogEntry.
    logName: Optional. A default log resource name that is assigned to all log
      entries in entries that do not specify a value for log_name:
      "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      "folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]" [LOG_ID] must be URL-encoded. For
      example: "projects/my-project-id/logs/syslog" "organizations/1234567890/
      logs/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity" The permission
      logging.logEntries.create is needed on each project, organization,
      billing account, or folder that is receiving new log entries, whether
      the resource is specified in logName or in an individual log entry.
    partialSuccess: Optional. Whether valid entries should be written even if
      some other entries fail due to INVALID_ARGUMENT or PERMISSION_DENIED
      errors. If any entry is not written, then the response status is the
      error associated with one of the failed entries and the response
      includes error details keyed by the entries' zero-based index in the
      entries.write method.
    resource: Optional. A default monitored resource object that is assigned
      to all log entries in entries that do not specify a value for resource.
      Example: { "type": "gce_instance",   "labels": {     "zone": "us-
      central1-a", "instance_id": "00000000000000000000" }} See LogEntry.
