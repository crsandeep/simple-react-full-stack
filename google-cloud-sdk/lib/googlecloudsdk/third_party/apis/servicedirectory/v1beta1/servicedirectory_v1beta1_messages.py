      AUTHORITY: Either principal or (if present) authority selector.
      ATTRIBUTION: The principal (even if an authority selector is present),
        which must only be used for attribution, not authorization.
      SECURITY_REALM: Any of the security realms in the IAMContext (go
        /security-realms). When used with IN, the condition indicates "any of
        the request's realms match one of the given values; with NOT_IN, "none
        of the realms match any of the given values". Note that a value can

        same  security realm)  - 'self:cloud-region' (i.e., allow connections

        'campus-abc')  - a realm group (e.g., 'realms-for-borg-cell-xx', see:
        go/realm-groups) A match is determined by a realm group membership
        check performed by a RealmAclRep object (go/realm-acl-howto). It is
        not permitted to grant access based on the *absence* of a realm, so
        realm conditions can only be used in a "positive" context (e.g.,
        ALLOW/IN or DENY/NOT_IN).
      APPROVER: An approver (distinct from the requester) that has authorized
        this request. When used with IN, the condition indicates that one of
        the approvers associated with the request matches the specified
        principal, or is a member of the specified group. Approvers can only
        grant additional access, and are thus only used in a strictly positive
        context (e.g. ALLOW/IN or DENY/NOT_IN).
      JUSTIFICATION_TYPE: What types of justifications have been supplied with
        this request. String values should match enum names from
        security.credentials.JustificationType, e.g. "MANUAL_STRING". It is
        not permitted to grant access based on the *absence* of a
        justification, so justification conditions can only be used in a
        "positive" context (e.g., ALLOW/IN or DENY/NOT_IN).  Multiple
        justifications, e.g., a Buganizer ID and a manually-entered reason,
        are normal and supported.
      CREDENTIALS_TYPE: What type of credentials have been supplied with this
        request. String values should match enum names from
        security_loas_l2.CredentialsType - currently, only
        CREDS_TYPE_EMERGENCY is supported. It is not permitted to grant access

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources.   A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  Optionally, a
  `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
  allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
  condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
  resource, or both.  **JSON example:**      {       "bindings": [         {
  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",           "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com",             "group:admins@example.com",
  "domain:google.com",             "serviceAccount:my-project-
  id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"           ]         },         {
  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer",           "members":
  ["user:eve@example.com"],           "condition": {             "title":

  version: 3  For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    iamOwned: A boolean attribute.
    rules: If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the
      following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any
      DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied.   Logging will be
      applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if
      any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is   granted.
      Logging will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. -
      Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy   that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.  If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset.
