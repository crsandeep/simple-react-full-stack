      deployment of the function.
    buildWorkerPool: Name of the Cloud Build Custom Worker Pool that should be
      used to build the function. The format of this field is
      `projects/{project}/workerPools/{workerPool}` where {project} is the
      project id where the worker pool is defined and {workerPool} is the

      be granted the role Cloud Build Custom Workers Builder
      (roles/cloudbuild.customworkers.builder) in the project.
    description: User-provided description of a function.
    entryPoint: The name of the function (as defined in source code) that will
      be executed. Defaults to the resource name suffix, if not specified. For
      backward compatibility, if function with given name is not found, then
      the system will try to use function named "function". For Node.js this
      is name of a function exported by the module specified in
      `source_location`.

    network: The VPC Network that this cloud function can connect to. It can
      be either the fully-qualified URI, or the short name of the network
      resource. If the short network name is used, the network must belong to
      the same project. Otherwise, it must belong to a project within the same
      organization. The format of this field is either
      `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}` or `{network}`, where
      {project} is a project id where the network is defined, and {network} is
      the short name of the network.  This field is mutually exclusive with
      `vpc_connector` and will be replaced by it.  See [the VPC
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vpc) for more
      information on connecting Cloud projects.
    runtime: The runtime in which to run the function. Required when deploying
      a new function, optional when updating an existing function. For a
      complete list of possible choices, see the [`gcloud` command
      reference](/sdk/gcloud/reference/functions/deploy#--runtime).
    serviceAccountEmail: The email of the function's service account. If
      empty, defaults to `{project_id}@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`.
    sourceArchiveUrl: The Google Cloud Storage URL, starting with gs://,
      pointing to the zip archive which contains the function.
    sourceRepository: **Beta Feature**  The source repository where a function
      is hosted.
    sourceUploadUrl: The Google Cloud Storage signed URL used for source
      uploading, generated by google.cloud.functions.v1.GenerateUploadUrl
    status: Output only. Status of the function deployment.
    timeout: The function execution timeout. Execution is considered failed
      and can be terminated if the function is not completed at the end of the
      timeout period. Defaults to 60 seconds.
    updateTime: Output only. The last update timestamp of a Cloud Function.
    versionId: Output only. The version identifier of the Cloud Function. Each
      deployment attempt results in a new version of a function being created.
    vpcConnector: The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can
      connect to. It can be either the fully-qualified URI, or the short name
      of the network connector resource. The format of this field is
      `projects/*/locations/*/connectors/*`  This field is mutually exclusive

    resource: Required. The resource(s) from which to observe events, for
      example, `projects/_/buckets/myBucket`.  Not all syntactically correct
      values are accepted by all services. For example:  1. The authorization
      model must support it. Google Cloud Functions    only allows
      EventTriggers to be deployed that observe resources in the    same
      project as the `CloudFunction`. 2. The resource type must match the
      pattern expected for an    `event_type`. For example, an `EventTrigger`
      that has an    `event_type` of "google.pubsub.topic.publish" should have
      a resource    that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.  Additionally,
      some services may support short names when creating an `EventTrigger`.
      These will always be returned in the normalized "long" format.  See each
      *service's* documentation for supported formats.
    service: The hostname of the service that should be observed.  If no
      string is provided, the default service implementing the API will be
      used. For example, `storage.googleapis.com` is the default for all event
      types in the `google.storage` namespace.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources.   A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  Optionally, a
  `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
  allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
  condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
  resource, or both.  **JSON example:**      {       "bindings": [         {
  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",           "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com",             "group:admins@example.com",

  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy   that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.  If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset.
