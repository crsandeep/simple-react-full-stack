The nature of the wrapping key depends on the choice of\nimport_method. When the wrapping key generation\nis complete, the state will be set to\nACTIVE and the public_key\ncan be fetched.

Cloud KMS uses the private key portion of the wrapping key to\nunwrap the key material. Only Cloud KMS has access to the private key.\n\nAn ImportJob expires 3 days after it is created.
