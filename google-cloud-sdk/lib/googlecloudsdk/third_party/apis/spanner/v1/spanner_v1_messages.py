    StateValueValuesEnum: Output only. The current state of the backup.

  Fields:
    createTime: Output only. The backup will contain an externally consistent
      copy of the database at the timestamp specified by `create_time`.
      `create_time` is approximately the time the CreateBackup request is
      received.
    database: Required for the CreateBackup operation. Name of the database
      from which this backup was created. This needs to be in the same
      instance as the backup. Values are of the form
      `projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/databases/<database>`.
    expireTime: Required for the CreateBackup operation. The expiration time
      of the backup, with microseconds granularity that must be at least 6
      hours and at most 366 days from the time the CreateBackup request is
      processed. Once the `expire_time` has passed, the backup is eligible to
      be automatically deleted by Cloud Spanner to free the resources used by
      the backup.
    name: Output only for the CreateBackup operation. Required for the
      UpdateBackup operation.  A globally unique identifier for the backup
      which cannot be changed. Values are of the form
      `projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/backups/a-z*[a-z0-9]` The final
      segment of the name must be between 2 and 60 characters in length.  The

      configuration of the instance containing the backup, identified by the
      prefix of the backup name of the form
      `projects/<project>/instances/<instance>`.
    referencingDatabases: Output only. The names of the restored databases
      that reference the backup. The database names are of the form
      `projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/databases/<database>`.
      Referencing databases may exist in different instances. The existence of
      any referencing database prevents the backup from being deleted. When a
      restored database from the backup enters the `READY` state, the
      reference to the backup is removed.

class KeyRange(_messages.Message):
  r"""KeyRange represents a range of rows in a table or index.  A range has a
  start key and an end key. These keys can be open or closed, indicating if
  the range includes rows with that key.  Keys are represented by lists, where
  the ith value in the list corresponds to the ith component of the table or
  index primary key. Individual values are encoded as described here.  For
  example, consider the following table definition:      CREATE TABLE
  UserEvents (       UserName STRING(MAX),       EventDate STRING(10)     )
  PRIMARY KEY(UserName, EventDate);  The following keys name rows in this
  table:      "Bob", "2014-09-23"  Since the `UserEvents` table's `PRIMARY
  KEY` clause names two columns, each `UserEvents` key has two elements; the
  first is the `UserName`, and the second is the `EventDate`.  Key ranges with
  multiple components are interpreted lexicographically by component using the
  table or index key's declared sort order. For example, the following range
  returns all events for user `"Bob"` that occurred in the year 2015:
  "start_closed": ["Bob", "2015-01-01"]     "end_closed": ["Bob",
  "2015-12-31"]  Start and end keys can omit trailing key components. This
  affects the inclusion and exclusion of rows that exactly match the provided
  key components: if the key is closed, then rows that exactly match the
  provided components are included; if the key is open, then rows that exactly
  match are not included.  For example, the following range includes all
  events for `"Bob"` that occurred during and after the year 2000:
  "start_closed": ["Bob", "2000-01-01"]     "end_closed": ["Bob"]  The next
  example retrieves all events for `"Bob"`:      "start_closed": ["Bob"]
  "end_closed": ["Bob"]  To retrieve events before the year 2000:
  "start_closed": ["Bob"]     "end_open": ["Bob", "2000-01-01"]  The following
  range includes all rows in the table:      "start_closed": []
  "end_closed": []  This range returns all users whose `UserName` begins with
  any character from A to C:      "start_closed": ["A"]     "end_open": ["D"]
  This range returns all users whose `UserName` begins with B:
  "start_closed": ["B"]     "end_open": ["C"]  Key ranges honor column sort
  order. For example, suppose a table is defined as follows:      CREATE TABLE
  DescendingSortedTable {       Key INT64,       ...     ) PRIMARY KEY(Key
  DESC);  The following range retrieves all rows with key values between 1 and
  100 inclusive:      "start_closed": ["100"]     "end_closed": ["1"]  Note
  that 100 is passed as the start, and 1 is passed as the end, because `Key`
  is a descending column in the schema.

    startClosed: If the start is closed, then the range includes all rows
      whose first `len(start_closed)` key columns exactly match

      be combined with more values from subsequent `PartialResultSet`s to
      obtain a complete field value.
    metadata: Metadata about the result set, such as row type information.
      Only present in the first response.
    resumeToken: Streaming calls might be interrupted for a variety of
      reasons, such as TCP connection loss. If this occurs, the stream of
      results can be resumed by re-sending the original request and including
      `resume_token`. Note that executing any other transaction in the same
      session invalidates the token.
    stats: Query plan and execution statistics for the statement that produced
      this streaming result set. These can be requested by setting
      ExecuteSqlRequest.query_mode and are sent only once with the last
      response in the stream. This field will also be present in the last
      response for DML statements.
    values: A streamed result set consists of a stream of values, which might
      be split into many `PartialResultSet` messages to accommodate large rows
      and/or large values. Every N complete values defines a row, where N is
      equal to the number of entries in metadata.row_type.fields.  Most values
      are encoded based on type as described here.  It is possible that the
      last value in values is "chunked", meaning that the rest of the value is
      sent in subsequent `PartialResultSet`(s). This is denoted by the
      chunked_value field. Two or more chunked values can be merged to form a
      complete value as follows:    * `bool/number/null`: cannot be chunked
      * `string`: concatenate the strings   * `list`: concatenate the lists.
      If the last element in a list is a     `string`, `list`, or `object`,
      merge it with the first element in     the next list by applying these
      rules recursively.   * `object`: concatenate the (field name, field
      value) pairs. If a     field name is duplicated, then apply these rules
      recursively     to merge the field values.  Some examples of merging:
      # Strings are concatenated.     "foo", "bar" => "foobar"      # Lists of
      non-strings are concatenated.     [2, 3], [4] => [2, 3, 4]      # Lists
      are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged     #
      because they are strings.     ["a", "b"], ["c", "d"] => ["a", "bc", "d"]
      # Lists are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged
      # because they are lists. Recursively, the last and first elements     #
      of the inner lists are merged because they are strings.     ["a", ["b",
      "c"]], [["d"], "e"] => ["a", ["b", "cd"], "e"]      # Non-overlapping
      object fields are combined.     {"a": "1"}, {"b": "2"} => {"a": "1",
      "b": 2"}      # Overlapping object fields are merged.     {"a": "1"},
      {"a": "2"} => {"a": "12"}      # Examples of merging objects containing
      lists of strings.     {"a": ["1"]}, {"a": ["2"]} => {"a": ["12"]}  For a
      more complete example, suppose a streaming SQL query is yielding a
      result set whose rows contain a single string field. The following
      `PartialResultSet`s might be yielded:      {       "metadata": { ... }
      "values": ["Hello", "W"]       "chunked_value": true
      "resume_token": "Af65..."     }     {       "values": ["orl"]
      "chunked_value": true       "resume_token": "Bqp2..."     }     {
      "values": ["d"]       "resume_token": "Zx1B..."     }  This sequence of
      `PartialResultSet`s encodes two rows, one containing the field value
      `"Hello"`, and a second containing the field value `"World" = "W" +

  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  Optionally, a
  `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that

    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a

class ReadOnly(_messages.Message):

  Fields:
    exactStaleness: Executes all reads at a timestamp that is
      `exact_staleness` old. The timestamp is chosen soon after the read is
      started.  Guarantees that all writes that have committed more than the
      specified number of seconds ago are visible. Because Cloud Spanner
      chooses the exact timestamp, this mode works even if the client's local
      clock is substantially skewed from Cloud Spanner commit timestamps.
      Useful for reading at nearby replicas without the distributed timestamp
      negotiation overhead of `max_staleness`.
    maxStaleness: Read data at a timestamp >= `NOW - max_staleness` seconds.
      Guarantees that all writes that have committed more than the specified
      number of seconds ago are visible. Because Cloud Spanner chooses the
      exact timestamp, this mode works even if the client's local clock is
      substantially skewed from Cloud Spanner commit timestamps.  Useful for
      reading the freshest data available at a nearby replica, while bounding
      the possible staleness if the local replica has fallen behind.  Note
      that this option can only be used in single-use transactions.
    minReadTimestamp: Executes all reads at a timestamp >=
      `min_read_timestamp`.  This is useful for requesting fresher data than
      some previous read, or data that is fresh enough to observe the effects
      of some previously committed transaction whose timestamp is known.  Note
      that this option can only be used in single-use transactions.  A
      timestamp in RFC3339 UTC \"Zulu\" format, accurate to nanoseconds.
      Example: `"2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z"`.
    readTimestamp: Executes all reads at the given timestamp. Unlike other
      modes, reads at a specific timestamp are repeatable; the same read at
      the same timestamp always returns the same data. If the timestamp is in
      the future, the read will block until the specified timestamp, modulo
      the read's deadline.  Useful for large scale consistent reads such as
      mapreduces, or for coordinating many reads against a consistent snapshot
      of the data.  A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC \"Zulu\" format, accurate to
      nanoseconds. Example: `"2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z"`.
    returnReadTimestamp: If true, the Cloud Spanner-selected read timestamp is
      included in the Transaction message that describes the transaction.

      result rows. See key_set for further information.
    keySet: Required. `key_set` identifies the rows to be yielded. `key_set`
      names the primary keys of the rows in table to be yielded, unless index
      is present. If index is present, then key_set instead names index keys
      in index.  If the partition_token field is empty, rows are yielded in
      table primary key order (if index is empty) or index key order (if index
      is non-empty).  If the partition_token field is not empty, rows will be
      yielded in an unspecified order.  It is not an error for the `key_set`
      to name rows that do not exist in the database. Read yields nothing for
      nonexistent rows.
    limit: If greater than zero, only the first `limit` rows are yielded. If
      `limit` is zero, the default is no limit. A limit cannot be specified if

  r"""# Transactions   Each session can have at most one active transaction at
  a time. After the active transaction is completed, the session can
  immediately be re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to
  create a new session for each transaction.  # Transaction Modes  Cloud
  Spanner supports three transaction modes:    1. Locking read-write. This
  type of transaction is the only way      to write data into Cloud Spanner.
  These transactions rely on      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-
  phase commit.      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
  application to retry.    2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type
  provides guaranteed      consistency across several reads, but does not
  allow      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
  read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only      transactions do not
  need to be committed.    3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is
  used to execute      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML
  partitions      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
  in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
  independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
  committed.  For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
  provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In particular, read-
  only transactions do not take locks, so they do not conflict with read-write
  transactions. As a consequence of not taking locks, they also do not abort,
  so retry loops are not needed.  Transactions may only read/write data in a
  single database. They may, however, read/write data in different tables
  within that database.  ## Locking Read-Write Transactions  Locking
  transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write data anywhere in a
  database. This type of transaction is externally consistent.  Clients should
  attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction is active. Faster
  transactions commit with higher probability and cause less contention. Cloud
  Spanner attempts to keep read locks active as long as the transaction
  continues to do reads, and the transaction has not been terminated by Commit
  or Rollback.  Long periods of inactivity at the client may cause Cloud
  Spanner to release a transaction's locks and abort it.  Conceptually, a
  read-write transaction consists of zero or more reads or SQL statements
  followed by Commit. At any time before Commit, the client can send a
  Rollback request to abort the transaction.  ### Semantics  Cloud Spanner can
  commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired are still valid at
  commit time, and it is able to acquire write locks for all writes. Cloud
  Spanner can abort the transaction for any reason. If a commit attempt
  returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees that the transaction has not
  modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.  Unless the transaction commits,
  Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about how long the transaction's locks
  were held for. It is an error to use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of
  mutual exclusion other than between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
  ### Retrying Aborted Transactions  When a transaction aborts, the
  application can choose to retry the whole transaction again. To maximize the
  chances of successfully committing the retry, the client should execute the
  retry in the same session as the original attempt. The original session's
  lock priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
  attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.  Under
  some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to modify the same
  row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a short period before
  successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good idea to cap the number of
  retries a transaction can attempt; instead, it is better to limit the total
  amount of wall time spent retrying.  ### Idle Transactions  A transaction is
  considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or SQL queries and has not
  started a read or SQL query within the last 10 seconds. Idle transactions
  can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they don't hold on to locks
  indefinitely. In that case, the commit will fail with error `ABORTED`.  If
  this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple SQL query in
  the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the transaction from becoming
  idle.  ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions  Snapshot read-only transactions
  provides a simpler method than locking read-write transactions for doing
  several consistent reads. However, this type of transaction does not support
  writes.  Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
  choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
  timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block concurrent
  read-write transactions.  Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot
  read-only transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
  timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage collection
  policy is generous enough that most applications do not need to worry about
  this in practice.  Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
  Commit or Rollback (and in fact are not permitted to do so).  To execute a
  snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp bound, which tells
  Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.  The types of timestamp bound
  are:    - Strong (the default).   - Bounded staleness.   - Exact staleness.
  If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
  stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong or read-
  write transaction, because they are able to execute far from the leader
  replica.  Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.  ###
  Strong  Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
  that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all rows
  yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if any part of
  the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the transaction.
  Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
  transactions might return inconsistent results if there are concurrent
  writes. If consistency across reads is required, the reads should be
  executed within a transaction or at an exact read timestamp.  See
  TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.  ### Exact Staleness  These timestamp
  bounds execute reads at a user-specified timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are
  guaranteed to see a consistent prefix of the global transaction history:
  they observe modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp
  <= the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
  transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until all
  conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps <= the read
  timestamp have finished.  The timestamp can either be expressed as an
  absolute Cloud Spanner commit timestamp or a staleness relative to the
  current time.  These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
  timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the equivalent
  boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand, boundedly stale reads
  usually return fresher results.  See
  TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
  TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.  ### Bounded Staleness  Bounded
  staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp, subject to a
  user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the newest timestamp
  within the staleness bound that allows execution of the reads at the closest
  available replica without blocking.  All rows yielded are consistent with
  each other -- if any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of
  the read see the transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two
  stale reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
  different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.  Boundedly stale
  reads execute in two phases: the first phase negotiates a timestamp among
  all replicas needed to serve the read. In the second phase, reads are
  executed at the negotiated timestamp.  As a result of the two phase
  execution, bounded staleness reads are usually a little slower than
  comparable exact staleness reads. However, they are typically able to return
  fresher results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
  Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of which rows
  will be read, it can only be used with single-use read-only transactions.
  See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
  TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.  ### Old Read Timestamps and
  Garbage Collection  Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and
  overwritten data in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is
  known as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
  are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads at
  read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This restriction also
  applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose timestamp become too
  old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with too-old read timestamps fail
  with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.  ## Partitioned DML Transactions
  Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
  different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
  scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
  ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
  should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.  Partitioned DML partitions the
  keyspace and runs the DML statement on each partition in separate, internal
  transactions. These transactions commit automatically when complete, and run
  independently from one another.  To reduce lock contention, this execution
  strategy only acquires read locks on rows that match the WHERE clause of the
  statement. Additionally, the smaller per-partition transactions hold locks
  for less time.  That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for
  standard DML used in ReadWrite transactions.   - The DML statement must be
  fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement    must be expressible as
  the union of many statements which each access only    a single row of the
  table.   - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table.
  Rather,    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table,
  in    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
  with the base table rows.   - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-
  once execution semantics    against a partition. The statement will be
  applied at least once to each    partition. It is strongly recommended that
  the DML statement should be    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For
  instance, it is potentially    dangerous to run a statement such as
  `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
  against some rows.   - The partitions are committed automatically - there is
  no support for    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if
  the client issuing    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some
  rows had the statement    executed on them successfully. It is also possible
  that statement was    never executed against other rows.   - Partitioned DML
  transactions may only contain the execution of a single    DML statement via
  ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.   - If any error is encountered during
  the execution of the partitioned DML    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE
  INDEX violation, division by zero, or a    value that cannot be stored due
  to schema constraints), then the    operation is stopped at that point and
  an error is returned. It is    possible that at this point, some partitions
  have been committed (or even    committed multiple times), and other
  partitions have not been run at all.  Given the above, Partitioned DML is
  good fit for large, database-wide, operations that are idempotent, such as
  deleting old rows from a very large table.

  another batch of statements is applied first and it conflicts in some way,

  which `NOT NULL` would be added). If a statement fails, all subsequent

      fields can be combined to form the name of the resulting
