      ATTRIBUTION: The principal (even if an authority selector is present),
        which must only be used for attribution, not authorization.
      SECURITY_REALM: Any of the security realms in the IAMContext (go
        /security-realms). When used with IN, the condition indicates "any of
        the request's realms match one of the given values; with NOT_IN, "none
        of the realms match any of the given values". Note that a value can
        be:  - 'self' (i.e., allow connections from clients that are in the
        same  security realm)  - 'self:cloud-region' (i.e., allow connections
        from clients that are in  the same cloud region)  - a realm (e.g.,
        'campus-abc')  - a realm group (e.g., 'realms-for-borg-cell-xx', see:
        go/realm-groups) A match is determined by a realm group membership
        check performed by a RealmAclRep object (go/realm-acl-howto). It is
        not permitted to grant access based on the *absence* of a realm, so
        realm conditions can only be used in a "positive" context (e.g.,
        ALLOW/IN or DENY/NOT_IN).
      APPROVER: An approver (distinct from the requester) that has authorized
        this request. When used with IN, the condition indicates that one of
        the approvers associated with the request matches the specified
        principal, or is a member of the specified group. Approvers can only
        grant additional access, and are thus only used in a strictly positive
        context (e.g. ALLOW/IN or DENY/NOT_IN).
      JUSTIFICATION_TYPE: What types of justifications have been supplied with
        this request. String values should match enum names from
        security.credentials.JustificationType, e.g. "MANUAL_STRING". It is
        not permitted to grant access based on the *absence* of a
        justification, so justification conditions can only be used in a
        "positive" context (e.g., ALLOW/IN or DENY/NOT_IN).  Multiple
        justifications, e.g., a Buganizer ID and a manually-entered reason,
        are normal and supported.
      CREDENTIALS_TYPE: What type of credentials have been supplied with this
        request. String values should match enum names from
        security_loas_l2.CredentialsType - currently, only
        CREDS_TYPE_EMERGENCY is supported. It is not permitted to grant access

  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources.   A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  Optionally, a
  `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
  allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
  condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
  resource, or both.  **JSON example:**      {       "bindings": [         {
  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",           "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com",             "group:admins@example.com",

  version: 3  For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    iamOwned: A boolean attribute.
    rules: If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the
      following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any
      DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied.   Logging will be
      applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if
      any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is   granted.
      Logging will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. -
      Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy   that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.  If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset.

class PostalAddress(_messages.Message):
  r"""Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments
  addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a
  premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical
  locations (roads, towns, mountains).  In typical usage an address would be
  created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the
  type of process.  Advice on address input / editing:  - Use an i18n-ready
  address widget such as    https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users
  should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of   fields
  outside countries where that field is used.  For more guidance on how to use
  this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478

  Fields:
    addressLines: Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an
      address.  Because values in address_lines do not have type information
      and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.
      "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order
      of address lines should be "envelope order" for the country/region of
      the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan),
      address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. "ja" for large-to-
      small ordering and "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). This way, the
      most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language.
      The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists
      of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the
      address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very
      approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made
      about any of the address components until it was at least partially
      resolved.  Creating an address only containing a region_code and
      address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle
      completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of
      the address should be localities or administrative areas).
    administrativeArea: Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is
      used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can
      be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for
      Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g.
      "Barcelona" and not "Catalonia"). Many countries don't use an
      administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should
      be left unpopulated.
    languageCode: Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this
      address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or
      is expected to match one of the languages used in the address'
      country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect
      formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness
      of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting
      related operations.  If this value is not known, it should be omitted
      (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default).  Examples: "zh-
      Hant", "ja", "ja-Latn", "en".
    locality: Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the
      address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the
      world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this
      structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
    organization: Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
    postalCode: Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or
      require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may
