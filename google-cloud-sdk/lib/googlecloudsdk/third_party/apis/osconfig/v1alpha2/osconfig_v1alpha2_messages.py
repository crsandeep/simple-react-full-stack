  packages to install or remove, package repository configurations, and

  Fields:
    assignment: Specifies the VMs that are assigned this policy. This allows
      you to target sets or groups of VMs by different parameters such as
      labels, names, OS, or zones.  Empty assignments will target ALL VMs
      underneath this policy.   Conflict Management  Policies that exist
      higher up in the resource hierarchy (closer to the Org) will override
      those lower down if there is a conflict.  At the same level in the
      resource hierarchy (ie. within a project), the service will prevent the
      creation of multiple policies that conflict with each other. If there
      are multiple policies that specify the same config (eg. package,
      software recipe, repository, etc.), the service will ensure that no VM
      could potentially receive instructions from both policies. To create
      multiple policies that specify different versions of a package or
      different configs for different Operating Systems, each policy must be
      mutually exclusive in their targeting according to labels, OS, or other
      criteria.  Different configs are identified for conflicts in different
      ways. Packages are identified by their name and the package manager(s)
      they target. Package repositories are identified by their unique id
      where applicable. Some package managers don't have a unique identifier
      for repositories and where that's the case, no uniqueness is validated
      by the service.  Note that if OS Inventory is disabled, a VM will not be
      assigned a policy that targets by OS because the service will see this
      VM's OS as unknown.
