      independently.
    members: Specifies the identities requesting access for a Cloud Platform

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources.   A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  Optionally, a
  `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
  allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
  condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
  resource, or both.  **JSON example:**      {       "bindings": [         {
  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",           "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com",             "group:admins@example.com",

  group:admins@example.com       - domain:google.com       - serviceAccount

  version: 3  For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy   that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.  If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset.

  r"""A subscription resource.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: See <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels">
      Creating and managing labels</a>.

  Fields:
    ackDeadlineSeconds: The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort
      basis) Pub/Sub waits for the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before
      resending the message. In the interval after the message is delivered
      and before it is acknowledged, it is considered to be
      <i>outstanding</i>. During that time period, the message will not be
      redelivered (on a best-effort basis).  For pull subscriptions, this
      value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override
      this value for a given message, call `ModifyAckDeadline` with the
      corresponding `ack_id` if using non-streaming pull or send the `ack_id`
      in a `StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest` if using streaming pull. The
      minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The maximum
      custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this
      parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.  For push
      delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the
      call to the push endpoint.  If the subscriber never acknowledges the
      message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message.
    deadLetterPolicy: A policy that specifies the conditions for dead
      lettering messages in this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not
      set, dead lettering is disabled.  The Cloud Pub/Sub service account
      associated with this subscriptions's parent project (i.e.,
      service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must
      have permission to Acknowledge() messages on this subscription.
      <b>EXPERIMENTAL:</b> This feature is part of a closed alpha release.
      This API might be changed in backward-incompatible ways and is not
      recommended for production use. It is not subject to any SLA or
      deprecation policy.
    enableMessageOrdering: If true, messages published with the same
      `ordering_key` in `PubsubMessage` will be delivered to the subscribers
      in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system.
      Otherwise, they may be delivered in any order. <b>EXPERIMENTAL:</b> This
      feature is part of a closed alpha release. This API might be changed in
      backward-incompatible ways and is not recommended for production use. It
      is not subject to any SLA or deprecation policy.
    expirationPolicy: A policy that specifies the conditions for this
      subscription's expiration. A subscription is considered active as long
      as any connected subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the
      subscription or is issuing operations on the subscription. If
      `expiration_policy` is not set, a *default policy* with `ttl` of 31 days
      will be used. The minimum allowed value for `expiration_policy.ttl` is 1
      day.
    filter: An expression written in the Cloud Pub/Sub filter language. If
      non-empty, then only `PubsubMessage`s whose `attributes` field matches
      the filter are delivered on this subscription. If empty, then no
      messages are filtered out. <b>EXPERIMENTAL:</b> This feature is part of
      a closed alpha release. This API might be changed in backward-
      incompatible ways and is not recommended for production use. It is not
      subject to any SLA or deprecation policy.
    labels: See <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels">
      Creating and managing labels</a>.
    messageRetentionDuration: How long to retain unacknowledged messages in
      the subscription's backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
      `retain_acked_messages` is true, then this also configures the retention
      of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a
      `Seek` can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more than 7 days or
      less than 10 minutes.
    name: Required. The name of the subscription. It must have the format
      `"projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}"`. `{subscription}`
      must start with a letter, and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers
      (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`),
      plus (`+`) or percent signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255
      characters in length, and it must not start with `"goog"`.
    pushConfig: If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is
      used to configure it. An empty `pushConfig` signifies that the
      subscriber will pull and ack messages using API methods.
    retainAckedMessages: Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If
      true, then messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog,
      even if they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the
      `message_retention_duration` window. This must be true if you would like
      to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-
      overview#seek_to_a_time"> Seek to a timestamp</a>.
    retryPolicy: A policy that specifies how Cloud Pub/Sub retries message
      delivery for this subscription.  If not set, the default retry policy is
      applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as
      possible for healthy subscribers. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs
      or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message.
      <b>EXPERIMENTAL:</b> This API might be changed in backward-incompatible
      ways and is not recommended for production use. It is not subject to any
      SLA or deprecation policy.
    topic: Required. The name of the topic from which this subscription is
      receiving messages. Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`. The
      value of this field will be `_deleted-topic_` if the topic has been
      deleted.
