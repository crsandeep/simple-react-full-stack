The Label Manager API allows users to create and manage definitions and

The API also allows binding these user-created labels to cloud resources to

    MetadataValue: Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.
      It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as
      create time. Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method
      that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type,
      if any.
    ResponseValue: The normal response of the operation in case of success.
      If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the
      response is `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
      `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other

    done: If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in

    name: The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same
      service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping,
      the `name` should be a resource name ending with
      `operations/{unique_id}`.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources.   A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`.
  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  Optionally, a
  `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
  allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
  condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
  resource, or both.  **JSON example:**      {       "bindings": [         {
  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",           "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com",             "group:admins@example.com",
  "domain:google.com",             "serviceAccount:my-project-
  id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"           ]         },         {
  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer",           "members":
  ["user:eve@example.com"],           "condition": {             "title":
  "expirable access",             "description": "Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020",             "expression": "request.time <
  timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')",           }         }       ],
  "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=",       "version": 3     }  **YAML example:**
  bindings:     - members:       - user:mike@example.com       -
  group:admins@example.com       - domain:google.com       - serviceAccount
  :my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com       role:
  roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin     - members:       -
  user:eve@example.com       role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition:         title: expirable access         description: Does not
  grant access after Sep 2020         expression: request.time <
  timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')     - etag: BwWWja0YfJA=     -
  version: 3  For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy   that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.  If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset.
