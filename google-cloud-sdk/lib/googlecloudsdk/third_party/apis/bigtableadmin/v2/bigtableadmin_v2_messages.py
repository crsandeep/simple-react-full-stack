class BigtableadminProjectsInstancesClustersBackupsListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A BigtableadminProjectsInstancesClustersBackupsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters backups listed in the response.
      The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and
      the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a
      string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be <, >,
      <=, >=, !=, =, or :. Colon ':' represents a HAS operator which is
      roughly synonymous with equality. Filter rules are case insensitive.
      The fields eligible for filtering are:   * `name`   * `source_table`   *
      `state`   * `start_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-
      DDTHH:MM:SSZ)   * `end_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-
      DDTHH:MM:SSZ)   * `expire_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-
      DDTHH:MM:SSZ)   * `size_bytes`  To filter on multiple expressions,
      provide each separate expression within parentheses. By default, each
      expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND, OR, and
      NOT expressions explicitly.  Some examples of using filters are:    *
      `name:"exact"` --> The backup's name is the string "exact".   *
      `name:howl` --> The backup's name contains the string "howl".   *
      `source_table:prod`          --> The source_table's name contains the
      string "prod".   * `state:CREATING` --> The backup is pending creation.
      * `state:READY` --> The backup is fully created and ready for use.   *
      `(name:howl) AND (start_time < \"2018-03-28T14:50:00Z\")`          -->
      The backup name contains the string "howl" and start_time
      of the backup is before 2018-03-28T14:50:00Z.   * `size_bytes >
      10000000000` --> The backup's size is greater than 10GB
    orderBy: An expression for specifying the sort order of the results of the
      request. The string value should specify one or more fields in Backup.
      The full syntax is described at https://aip.dev/132#ordering.  Fields
      supported are:    * name    * source_table    * expire_time    *
      start_time    * end_time    * size_bytes    * state  For example,
      "start_time". The default sorting order is ascending. To specify
      descending order for the field, a suffix " desc" should be appended to
      the field name. For example, "start_time desc". Redundant space
      characters in the syntax are insigificant.  If order_by is empty,
      results will be sorted by `start_time` in descending order starting from
      the most recently created backup.
    pageSize: Number of backups to be returned in the response. If 0 or less,
      defaults to the server's maximum allowed page size.
    pageToken: If non-empty, `page_token` should contain a next_page_token
      from a previous ListBackupsResponse to the same `parent` and with the
      same `filter`.
    parent: Required. The cluster to list backups from.  Values are of the
      form `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/clusters/{cluster}`. Use
      `{cluster} = '-'` to list backups for all clusters in an instance, e.g.,

  version: 3  For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy   that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.  If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset.
