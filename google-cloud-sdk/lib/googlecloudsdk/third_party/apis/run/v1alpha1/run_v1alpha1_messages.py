    clusterName: Not currently supported by Cloud Run.  The name of the

      resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field
      is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set
      in create or update request. +optional
    creationTimestamp: CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the
      server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set
      in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set
      this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.  Populated

      will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also
      set. May only be shortened. Read-only. +optional
    deletionTimestamp: DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which
      this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a
      graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable
      by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
      from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this
      field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list
      contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set,
      this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although
      it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
      For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The
      Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the
      containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a
      hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
      remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this
      object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or
      automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not
      set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.  Populated

      returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This
      value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has
      the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the
      length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.
      If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server

  Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains
  (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can
  be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  Optionally, a
  `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that
  allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
  condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
  resource, or both.  **JSON example:**      {       "bindings": [         {
  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",           "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com",             "group:admins@example.com",
  "domain:google.com",             "serviceAccount:my-project-
  id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"           ]         },         {
  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer",           "members":
  ["user:eve@example.com"],           "condition": {             "title":
  "expirable access",             "description": "Does not grant access after

  timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')",           }         }       ],
  "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=",       "version": 3     }  **YAML example:**
  bindings:     - members:       - user:mike@example.com       -
  group:admins@example.com       - domain:google.com       - serviceAccount

  version: 3  For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy   that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.  If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset.
