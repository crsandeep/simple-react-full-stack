  balancingMode:
    description: |-
      Specifies the balancing mode for the backend.  When choosing a balancing
      mode, you need to consider the loadBalancingScheme, and protocol for the
      backend service, as well as the type of backend (instance group or NEG).
      - If the load balancing mode is CONNECTION, then the load is spread based
      on how many concurrent connections the backend can handle. You can use the
      CONNECTION balancing mode if the protocol for the backend service is SSL,
      TCP, or UDP.  If the loadBalancingScheme for the backend service is
      EXTERNAL (SSL Proxy and TCP Proxy load balancers), you must also specify
      exactly one of the following parameters: maxConnections,
      maxConnectionsPerInstance, or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint.  If the
      loadBalancingScheme for the backend service is INTERNAL (internal TCP/UDP
      load balancers), you cannot specify any additional parameters.   - If the
      load balancing mode is RATE, the load is spread based on the rate of HTTP
      requests per second (RPS). You can use the RATE balancing mode if the
      protocol for the backend service is HTTP or HTTPS. You must specify
      exactly one of the following parameters: maxRate, maxRatePerInstance, or
      maxRatePerEndpoint.   - If the load balancing mode is UTILIZATION, the
      load is spread based on the CPU utilization of instances in an instance
      group. You can use the UTILIZATION balancing mode if the
      loadBalancingScheme of the backend service is EXTERNAL,
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_MANAGED and the backends are instance
      groups. There are no restrictions on the backend service protocol.
    type: string
    enum:
    - CONNECTION
    - RATE
    - UTILIZATION
  capacityScaler:
    description: |-
      A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing capacity (based on
      UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION). Default value is 1, which means the
      group will serve up to 100% of its configured capacity (depending on
      balancingMode). A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained,
      offering 0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].  This
      cannot be used for internal load balancing.
    type: number
  description:
    description: |-
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you
      create the resource.
    type: string
  failover:
    description: |-
      This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More than one
      failover backend can be configured for a given BackendService.
    type: boolean
  group:
    description: |-
      The fully-qualified URL of an instance group or network endpoint group
      (NEG) resource. The type of backend that a backend service supports
      depends on the backend service's loadBalancingScheme.    - When the
      loadBalancingScheme for the backend service is EXTERNAL,
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_MANAGED, the backend can be either an
      instance group or a NEG. The backends on the backend service must be
      either all instance groups or all NEGs. You cannot mix instance group and
      NEG backends on the same backend service.    - When the
      loadBalancingScheme for the backend service is INTERNAL, the backend must
      be an instance group in the same region as the backend service. NEGs are
      not supported.    You must use the fully-qualified URL (starting with
      https://www.googleapis.com/) to specify the instance group or NEG. Partial
      URLs are not supported.
    type: string
  maxConnections:
    description: |-
      Defines a maximum target for simultaneous connections for the entire
      backend (instance group or NEG). If the backend's balancingMode is
      UTILIZATION, this is an optional parameter. If the backend's balancingMode
      is CONNECTION, and backend is attached to a backend service whose
      loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, you must specify either this parameter,
      maxConnectionsPerInstance, or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint.  Not available if
      the backend's balancingMode is RATE. If the loadBalancingScheme is
      INTERNAL, then maxConnections is not supported, even though the backend
      requires a balancing mode of CONNECTION.
    type: integer
  maxConnectionsPerEndpoint:
    description: |-
      Defines a maximum target for simultaneous connections for an endpoint of a
      NEG. This is multiplied by the number of endpoints in the NEG to
      implicitly calculate a maximum number of target maximum simultaneous
      connections for the NEG. If the backend's balancingMode is CONNECTION, and
      the backend is attached to a backend service whose loadBalancingScheme is
      EXTERNAL, you must specify either this parameter, maxConnections, or
      maxConnectionsPerInstance.  Not available if the backend's balancingMode
      is RATE. Internal TCP/UDP load balancing does not support setting
      maxConnectionsPerEndpoint even though its backends require a balancing
      mode of CONNECTION.
    type: integer
  maxConnectionsPerInstance:
    description: |-
      Defines a maximum target for simultaneous connections for a single VM in a
      backend instance group. This is multiplied by the number of instances in
      the instance group to implicitly calculate a target maximum number of
      simultaneous connections for the whole instance group. If the backend's
      balancingMode is UTILIZATION, this is an optional parameter. If the
      backend's balancingMode is CONNECTION, and backend is attached to a
      backend service whose loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, you must specify
      either this parameter, maxConnections, or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint.  Not
      available if the backend's balancingMode is RATE. Internal TCP/UDP load
      balancing does not support setting maxConnectionsPerInstance even though
      its backends require a balancing mode of CONNECTION.
    type: integer
  maxRate:
    description: |-
      The max requests per second (RPS) of the group. Can be used with either
      RATE or UTILIZATION balancing modes, but required if RATE mode. For RATE
      mode, either maxRate or maxRatePerInstance must be set.  This cannot be
      used for internal load balancing.
    type: integer
  maxRatePerEndpoint:
    description: |-
      Defines a maximum target for requests per second (RPS) for an endpoint of
      a NEG. This is multiplied by the number of endpoints in the NEG to
      implicitly calculate a target maximum rate for the NEG. If the backend's
      balancingMode is RATE, you must specify either this parameter, maxRate, or
      maxRatePerInstance.  Not available if the backend's balancingMode is
      CONNECTION.
    type: number
  maxRatePerInstance:
    description: |-
      Defines a maximum target for requests per second (RPS) for a single VM in
      a backend instance group. This is multiplied by the number of instances in
      the instance group to implicitly calculate a target maximum rate for the
      whole instance group.  If the backend's balancingMode is UTILIZATION, this
      is an optional parameter. If the backend's balancingMode is RATE, you must
      specify either this parameter, maxRate, or maxRatePerEndpoint.  Not
      available if the backend's balancingMode is CONNECTION.
    type: number
  maxUtilization:
    description: |-
      Defines the maximum average CPU utilization of a backend VM in an instance
      group. The valid range is [0.0, 1.0]. This is an optional parameter if the
      backend's balancingMode is UTILIZATION.  This parameter can be used in
      conjunction with maxRate, maxRatePerInstance, maxConnections, or
      maxConnectionsPerInstance.
