      The short description conveying the intent of this routeRule. The
      description can have a maximum length of 1024 characters.
    type: string
  headerAction:
    description: |-
      Specifies changes to request and response headers that need to take effect
      for the selected backendService. The headerAction specified here are
      applied before the matching pathMatchers[].headerAction and after
      pathMatchers[].routeRules[].routeA

  matchRules:

    type: array

  priority:
    description: |-
      For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the
      order in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are
      evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The
      priority of a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1).
      The first rule that matches the request is applied. You cannot
      configure two or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority for
      each rule must be set to a number between 0 and 2147483647 inclusive.
      Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove
      rules in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For
      example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority
      numbers to which you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11,
      and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact on existing rules.
    type: integer
  routeAction:
    description: |-
      In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer performs
      advanced routing actions like URL rewrites, header transformations,
      etc. prior to forwarding the request to the selected backend. If
      routeAction specifies any  weightedBackendServices, service must not
      be set. Conversely if service is set, routeAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Only one of routeAction or urlRedirect must
      be set.
    $ref: HttpRouteAction.yaml
  service:
    description: |-
      The full or partial URL of the backend service resource to which
      traffic is directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is
      additionally specified, advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites,
      etc. take effect prior to sending the request to the backend. However,
      if service is specified, routeAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
      weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of
      urlRedirect, service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be
      set.
    type: string
  urlRedirect:
    description: |-
      When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL
      specified by urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service or
      routeAction must not be set.
