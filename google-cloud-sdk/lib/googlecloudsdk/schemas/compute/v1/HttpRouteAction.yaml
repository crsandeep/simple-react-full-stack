  corsPolicy:
    description: |-
      The specification for allowing client side cross-origin requests. Please
      see W3C Recommendation for Cross Origin Resource Sharing
    $ref: CorsPolicy.yaml
  faultInjectionPolicy:
    description: |-
      The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the
      resiliency of clients to backend service failure. As part of fault
      injection, when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be
      introduced by Loadbalancer on a percentage of requests before sending
      those request to the backend service. Similarly requests from clients can
      be aborted by the Loadbalancer for a percentage of requests. timeout and
      retry_policy will be ignored by clients that are configured with a
      fault_injection_policy.
    $ref: HttpFaultInjection.yaml
  requestMirrorPolicy:
    description: |-
      Specifies the policy on how requests intended for the route's backends are
      shadowed to a separate mirrored backend service. Loadbalancer does not
      wait for responses from the shadow service. Prior to sending traffic to
      the shadow service, the host / authority header is suffixed with -shadow.
    $ref: RequestMirrorPolicy.yaml
  retryPolicy:
    description: Specifies the retry policy associated with this route.
    $ref: HttpRetryPolicy.yaml
  timeout:
    description: |-
      Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the
      time the request has been fully processed (i.e. end-of-stream) up until
      the response has been completely processed. Timeout includes all retries.
      If not specified, will use the largest timeout among all backend services
      associated with the route.
    $ref: Duration.yaml
  urlRewrite:
    description: |-
      The spec to modify the URL of the request, prior to forwarding the request
      to the matched service
    $ref: UrlRewrite.yaml
  weightedBackendServices:
    description: |-
      A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match
      occurs. The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their
      corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single
      backend service, there must be one weightedBackendService with weight set
      to a non 0 number. Once a backendService is identified and before
      forwarding the request to the backend service, advanced routing actions
      like Url rewrites and header transformations are applied depending on
      additional settings specified in this HttpRouteAction.
