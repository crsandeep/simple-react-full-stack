      more hosts are added/removed from the destination service. This field
      specifies parameters that control consistent hashing. This field is
      only applicable when localityLbPolicy is set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH.
      This field is applicable to either:   - A regional backend service
      with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and
      load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED.  - A global backend
      service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

  loadBalancingScheme:
    description: |-
      Specifies the load balancer type. Choose EXTERNAL for load
      balancers that receive traffic from external clients. Choose
      INTERNAL for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing. Choose
      INTERNAL_MANAGED for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. Choose
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED for Traffic Director. A backend service
      created for one type of load balancing cannot be used with
      another. For more information, refer to Choosing a load
      balancer.

  localityLbPolicy:
    description: |-
      The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the
      locality. The possible values are:   - ROUND_ROBIN: This is a
      simple policy in which each healthy backend is selected in
      round robin order. This is the default.  - LEAST_REQUEST: An
      O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy hosts and
      picks the host which has fewer active requests.  - RING_HASH:
      The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
      hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
      addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
      1/N of the requests.  - RANDOM: The load balancer selects a
      random healthy host.  -

    description: |-
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource
      is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply
      with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters
      long and match the regular expression
      `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character
      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must

      character, which cannot be a dash.
