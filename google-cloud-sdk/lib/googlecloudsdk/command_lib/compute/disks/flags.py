      Source snapshot used to create the disks. It is safe to
      delete a snapshot after a disk has been created from the
      snapshot. In such cases, the disks will no longer reference
      the deleted snapshot. To get a list of snapshots in your
      current project, run `gcloud compute snapshots list`. A
      snapshot from an existing disk can be created using the
      `gcloud compute disks snapshot` command. This flag is mutually
      exclusive with *--image*.

      When using this option, the size of the disks must be at least
      as large as the snapshot size. Use *--size* to adjust the
      size of the disks.
