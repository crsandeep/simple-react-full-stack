    brief: Update the index configuration of the given field.
    description: |
      Update the index configuration of the given field.

      This creates an exemption for the field in question, allowing one to modify the field's index
      settings and override the defaults.
    # Note: currently all indexes are collection scoped; collection group scoped indexes are not yet
    # supported. When they are, these examples will need to be updated to include queryScope keys in
    # addition to order/arrayConfig.
    examples: |
      The following command creates an exemption for the `timestamp` field in the `Events`
      collection group, in which all indexes are disabled:

        $ {command} timestamp \
            --collection-group=Events
            --disable-indexes

      The following command creates an exemption for the `timestamp` field in the `Events`
      collection group, in which the list of indexes is explicitly set to [ASCENDING, DESCENDING]:

        $ {command} timestamp \
            --collection-group=Events \
            --index=order=ASCENDING \
            --index=order=DESCENDING

      The following command clears the exemption on the `timestamp` field in the `Events` collection
      group, so that the field will return to inheriting its index settings from its ancestors:

        $ {command} timestamp \
            --collection-group=Events --clear-exemption
